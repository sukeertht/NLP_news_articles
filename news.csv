28-Sep-18,City AM,Not hitting the right note: Shares dip as DCC announces Jam Group deal,"IRELAND-BASED DCC plans to buy Canada-based musical instruments distributor Jam Group for an enterprise value of $170m (£129.4m), the company said yesterday, as it continues to diversify its business through acquisitions. Shares closed down more than four per cent. DCC also said it planned to place up to 8.9m new shares with institutional investors and use the proceeds to drive its acquisition strategy. DCC said its first-half profit would be in line with its expectations, helped by acquisitions. DCC said its group operating profit would be well ahead of the prior year, driven by acquisitions completed in the prior year, and that trading across each division was also in line with expectations. ""The acquisition of Jam significantly strengthens DCC Technology's position in the North American market,"" chief executive Donal Murphy said in a statement. In February, DCC bought Elite One Source Nutritional Services marking its entry into the US healthcare market. DCC made its first acquisition outside its core markets in April 2017 when it agreed to buy Shell's liquefied petroleum gas unit in Hong Kong and Macau."
27-Sep-18,City AM,TP Icap unveils Square Mile headquarters,"THE WORLD'S largest interdealer broker yesterday revealed plans to move into a major new City headquarters in Broadgate, in an effort to house all of its brokers under one roof following the firm's merger in 2016. TP Icap will take up four floors of 135 Bishopsgate in a leasing that will see the FTSE 250 firm cover 123,000 square feet of office space. The move comes as the brokerage company, which merged the two firms of Tullett Prebon and Icap in 2016, looks to amalgamate its two current City offices around Liverpool Street. In recent months TP Icap has made similar such decisions across the world, having already signed commercial leases to move staff into new and bigger offices in cities such as Singapore, Sydney and New York. Yesterday's announcement is also a major coup for British Land, the property firm developing Broadgate, which has been making efforts to lure in major names to its mixed-use site since its makeover in the last decade. It is thought the move will happen in the spring of 2020 following a radical refurbishment of the building. Nicolas Breteau, boss of TP Icap, said: ""This is great news for our London-based employees, who will benefit from the excellent facilities available at 135 Bishopsgate. Our new headquarters reflect the ambition we have for our business and will provide an environment in which our competing brands will continue to thrive. It is also an important landmark in the group's integration as we reduce our global footprint of offices."" David Lockyer, head of Broadgate for British Land, said: ""The quality of Broadgate's offering and the service we provide here has been a key driver in TP Icap's decision to remain at the campus."""
26-Sep-18,City AM,Comcastacquires 30 per cent of Sky,"US MEDIA titan Comcast yesterday confirmed it had bought 30 per cent of shares in British broadcaster Sky so far after winning a dramatic auction for the company against 21st Century Fox on Saturday. Comcast told the market it had purchased 515,885,170 shares at its improved offer price of 1,728p per share. Sky investors have until 11 October to accept Comcast's bid, which it tabled when it beat Rupert Murdoch's Fox at the highly unusual auction last weekend. Sky's Independent Committee has already declared Comcast's offer as ""materially superior"" and strongly advised its investors to accept it immediately. Fox improved its 1,400p per share offer to 1,567p, but it was not enough to beat Comcast's bid, which values Sky at more than £30bn. It spoiled the party for Murdoch and Fox, which was looking to acquire the 61 per cent stake of Sky it does not already own. It's still unclear what Disney, which will soon own Fox's media assets including its Sky stake, will do with its holdings in the media firm. Sky shares jumped on Monday after news of Comcast's win, and are now trading around 1,726p, just below its offer price."
25-Sep-18,City AM,Comcast shares tank as news of £30bn Sky deal hits Wall Street,"MEDIA giant Comcast's share price yesterday suffered its worst day on the stock market in nine years, falling as much as eight per cent as investors feared the firm had overpaid in its acquisition of pay-TV giant Sky. In a conclusion to the heated corporate bidding war that lasted almost two years, the US cable television provider outbid rival 21st Century Fox in an auction over the weekend to close with a total offer of £30.6bn for control of Sky. The final offer came in at 1,728p per share from Comcast after three rounds of bidding in the UK's largest ever auction process by deal size, beating out Fox's offer of 1,567p. The deal makes Comcast the world's largest paid-for TV operator with roughly 52m customers. Sky shares, on the other hand, flew up almost nine per cent in trading yesterday. The firm's independent board called the auction ""an excellent outcome"", and urged shareholders to accept the deal immediately. CMC Markets chief analyst David Madden called the deal ""a good fit"", with the new group to be a ""truly global player"" in the years to come."
25-Sep-18,City AM,Barrick Gold in $18bn merger with Randgold,"TWO OF the world's largest gold producers are set to merge as Canada's Barrick Gold said it has agreed to buy London-listed Randgold Resources in a shock $18bn (£13.7bn) deal. In plans to create what Barrick Gold and Randgold Resources hailed as an ""industry-leading gold company"", the companies will be hoping to cement their footprints in most of North America and Africa after a challenging year for both firms. It would be the world's biggest gold miner with a value of about $18bn. Barrick, which has suffered a dip in outfall, will own around two-thirds of the new company while Randgold, which has been hit by a strike at one of its biggest mines, will own around a third. Mark Bristow, chief executive of Randgold, will become president and chief executive of the New Barrick Group. In a joint statement the companies yesterday said: ""The boards of Barrick and Randgold believe that the merger will create an industry-leading gold company with the greatest concentration of tier one gold assets in the industry, the lowest total cash cost position among senior gold peers."" A number of gold producers have struggled in the last year, with the growing strength of the US dollar making the commodity much more expensive for foreign buyers. Randgold shares on the London Stock Exchange will be cancelled and New Barrick Group will be listed in Toronto and New York, operating under the branding of the Barrick Group. Barclays and CIBC advised on the deal for Randgold and Morgan Stanley and M. Klein and Co. acted as advisers for Barrick."

20-Sep-18,City AM,Sainsbury's and Asda merger to be investigated,"A PROPOSED merger of retail giants Sainsbury's and Asda will receive further scrutiny after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said concerns over the deal merited deeper investigation. The watchdog warned that the two supermarkets currently ""overlap in hundreds of local areas"", meaning shoppers could face higher prices or worse service if the two were to merge, after its phase one investigation found the tie-up ""raises sufficient concerns"" for the probe to continue. ""These concerns will be considered further in the phase two investigation, along with other issues raised so far with the CMA - including those relating to fuel, general merchandise (such as clothing) and increased buyer power over suppliers,"" the CMA said. Sainsbury's wants to acquire its competitor in a £7.3bn deal that would narrow the field of major supermarkets in the UK. Sainsbury's and Asda each hold just over a 15 per cent share of the UK supermarket industry, according to Kantar Worldpanel figures released this month. Combined, the two British supermarkets would command almost £1 in every £3 spent on groceries. Mike Coupe, group chief executive of J Sainsbury, and Roger Burnley, president and chief executive of Asda, said: ""We expected the CMA would want to undertake an in-depth review and look forward to engaging with the CMA and panel on this next phase of the process."" The CMA's second phase will see its independent panel members gather evidence through customer surveys, discussions with rival retailers, suppliers and industry bodies. The watchdog has said that it would reject any deal that hurt customers. At the time of its launch, Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""About £190bn is spent each year on food and groceries in the UK so it's vital to find out if the millions of people who shop in supermarkets could lose out as a result of this deal."" The CMA has a statutory deadline of 5 March to reach a decision on whether to permit the merger."
19-Sep-18,City AM,Marsh to acquire City insurer JLT in £4.3bn deal,"NEW YORK-HEADQUARTERED Marsh & McLennan agreed to buy UK insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson (JLT) yesterday for £4.3bn. Shares in FTSE 250-listed JLT soared by more than 30 per cent following the announcement. Marsh has offered 1,915p in cash for each JLT share, valuing the business at £4.9bn. The offer represents a premium of 33.7 per cent to the closing price of 1,432p per share on 17 September, the last business day before the deal was announced. JLT shares are currently trading at 1,872p. The boards of both companies have recommended that shareholders accept the offer. Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said: ""We view the offer as fabulous for JLT shareholders. Its recent moves into the US has potentially been the trigger for Marsh to make the offer but irrespective of the reason this is a great price."" President and chief executive of Marsh, Dan Glaser, said the deal ""creates a compelling value proposition for our clients, our colleagues and our shareholders"". Marsh said it expects to make savings of $250m (£190m) over three years as a result of the deal. It said this would partly come through job cuts. Marsh said it expects to reduce headcount at the combined group by between two and five per cent. Marsh employs 65,000 people in more than 130 counties while JLT employs 10,000 people worldwide, including 4,000 in the UK. Potential job losses could number up to 3,500. Goldman Sachs is financial adviser to Marsh & McLennan, with Mark Sorrell as UK lead, with Slaughter and May providing legal advice. Financial advisers to JLT are JP Morgan Cazenove, with Conor Hillery leading, and Simon Robertson Associates, with Clifford Chance providing legal advice."
18-Sep-18,City AM,Top pension boss to lead salary takeover fund,"THE FORMER chairman of the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), Lawrence Churchill, was yesterday appointed as the inaugural chairman of emerging consolidator firm Clara Pensions. The industry figure will bring 40 years of experience to the role at the company, which consolidates firms' historic defined benefit pension schemes. Clara says it acts as a ""bridge"" for members from their current company sponsor to the insured market. He will take up the role alongside current positions as chairman of the Pensions Policy Institute and chairman of the Independent Governance Committee for Prudential. Churchill said: ""Spurred on by encouragement from the government, financial consolidation for defined benefit pension schemes has emerged as the newest frontier. ""I am greatly looking forward to helping pioneer what will hopefully become the route of choice for transferring pension savers from their pension scheme to a safer insured future."" Adam Saron, chief exec of Clara, added: ""As a life-long advocate for putting the interests of members and savers above all else, Lawrence truly embodies the member-first spirit on which Clara is built."" It comes as companies, most recently British Airways, look to strike deals to insure their large pension scheme liabilities."
17-Sep-18,City AM,Abu Dhabi Financial Group offers revised bid for Abraaj's ME funds,"ABU DHABI Financial Group (ADFG) has submitted a revised bid to acquire the management rights for the Middle East funds of stricken Dubai-based Abraaj, according to a document seen by Reuters. The Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment firm is among more than 12 bidders seeking to buy most of Abraaj's private equity funds. However, in a letter to investors in Abraaj Funds, ADFG said that the bid is unlikely to materialise given the ""convolution"" of the situation. To address this, ADFG is seeking a dedicated budget to conduct a full forensic audit and a litigation budget. Its new offer includes up to $6m (£4.6m) for the audit and litigation financing as well as a $10m credit facility to fund the operations of the Middle East funds. The $10m is in addition to $10m earmarked separately for the fund manager's liabilities. ""Such a dedicated budget is crucial not only to seek damages from previous management but also to ensure recoverability of funds for investors in the Middle East funds,"" ADFG said in the letter seen by Reuters. ""This means there is a zero capital call requirement from all the 200 unique investors in the Middle East funds which will clear one of the major hurdles going forward for the protection of the assets."""
13-Sep-18,City AM,Sports Direct AGM fuels Debenhams and House of Frasermerger talk,"THE PROSPECT of a merger between troubled high street giants Debenhams and House of Fraser arose at the annual shareholders' meeting yesterday of retailer Sports Direct, which owns the former and has a major stake in the latter. Debenhams' share price rose nine per cent at the suggestion of a linkup, which came after a question about the idea was put to Sports Direct's senior non-executive director, Simon Bentley. Bentley's reply to the original question from a reporter was: ""It's been discussed,"" Reuters reported. However, Bentley, who announced yesterday he was stepping down from the board along with chairman Keith Hellawell, later denied he had said that. ""I was asked a general question about whether or not we discuss our strategic investments, and in particular Debenhams, to which I replied in the positive,"" he said. ""I made no mention of any merger between House of Fraser and Debenhams, nor did I intend my answer to infer that."" The UK's largest sports-goods retailer Sports Direct International - majority-owned by the colourful chairman of Newcastle United FC Mike Ashley - bought department store chain House of Fraser out of administration in August. The firm already had a 29 per cent stake in the Debenhams store group. Ashley also survived a potential shareholder backlash at the company's AGM yesterday, with just under 10 per cent of investors voting against the re-election of the billionaire retail magnate as chief executive."
13-Sep-18,City AM,IWG financial chief exits after halted takeover,"SHARED office provider IWG said yesterday its chief financial and operating officer Dominik de Daniel will leave the company to pursue other opportunities. The FTSE 250 firm ended speculation over a potential takeover last month, halting talks with suitors and sending shares toppling. The Regus owner said it had appointed Eric Hageman as interim chief financial officer. Hageman has experience as head of finance at a number of listed companies, including TeleCity Group. De Daniel's exit also follows the firm issuing a profit warning in June, saying the cost of new sites and a downturn in its British business due to Brexit uncertainty had hit the company. Doug Sutherland, chairman of IWG, said: ""On behalf of the board I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dominik for his leadership and significant contributions during his time at IWG. ""Completing his third year, Dominik leaves the group with a strong balance sheet to support our growth ambitions."" De Daniel said: ""IWG has a bright future in what has become a hugely exciting growth sector. IWG's market-leading position, unique national networks and global footprint, coupled with recent investments, will allow the group to further realise its full potential."""

3-Sep-18,City AM,HNA Group cuts debt by £9bn in sell-off spree,"CHINA'S HNA Group reduced its debt load in the first half of 2018 as the company sold off assets acquired under a high-profile acquisition spree helmed by its former chairman, according to the company's latest financial report. HNA Group's total debt stood at 657.41bn yuan (£74.3bn) at the end of the first half, down 10.7 per cent or $11.6bn (£9bn) from the end of 2017. Despite the reduction, the group's total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio was 21.36 times at the end of the first half. The company reported a first-half net profit of 1.3bn yuan. HNA's push to sell off assets follows a $50bn spree led by former cochairman Wang Jian that saw HNA accumulate assets ranging from a stake in Deutsche Bank to highprofile overseas properties. The firm has faced scrutiny over the complex structures used to hold the stakes, including in Germany's biggest bank. Wang died during a business trip in France on 3 July. The conglomerate has since sold off many of those assets under pressure from Beijing, amid broader concerns over debt levels in the Chinese private sector. China's clampdown on aggressive overseas deals has also seen the likes of Dalian Wanda Group offloading billions of dollars worth of assets last year, while Anbang Insurance Group was taken over by the government this year. In early August, HNA Group announced a management reshuffle, in a move to calm worries about leadership at the conglomerate. An aviation-to-financial services conglomerate that counts Hainan Airlines as its core asset, HNA's recent sales include holdings in companies such as Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Park Hotels & Resorts and Spain's NH Hotels."
3-Sep-18,City AM,The Hut Group spurns offers as spree continues,"ONLINE beauty and lifestyle retail company The Hut Group (THG) has rebuffed a series of takeover deals as it looks to expand its own acquisition spending spree, according to reports. A number of offers valuing the firm at almost £4bn have been turned away by the fast-growing technology company, Sky News reported last night. While strategic and financial buyers hoping to snap up THG have been rejected, Sky News also said the e-commerce giant will announce it has bought beauty product maker Acheson & Acheson for between £50m and £100m later this week. The deal is said to add another 380 staff to THG's 3,000-strong workforce, which is expected to double by next year. The reports of further expansion plans come a month after THG secured more than $1bn (£771m) from banks to bolster its overseas growth by buying up more beauty and wellbeing businesses. In 2017 the firm spent more than £160m on strategic deals as part of a plan to widen its portfolio of brands, including skincare brand Espa and make-up business Illamasqua. With brands ranging from sports nutrition supplement Myprotein to haircare product maker Grow Gorgeous, the Manchester-based business is regularly on bankers' lists as a potential candidate for floating. Last year it reported a 47 per cent rise in sales over 12 months, with higher profits spurred by demand throughout international markets, particularly in the US. THG boss Matthew Moulding told Sky News the Acheson & Acheson deal was a ""truly exciting addition"" and ""one that uniquely positions THG to make a step-change in its innovation, operational excellence and manufacturing capacity""."
31-Aug-18,City AM,SSEmerger with Npower gets the initial go-ahead from UK watchdog,"THE COMPETITION and Markets Authority (CMA) yesterday gave provisional clearance to the proposed merger between energy provider Npower and the retail arm of SSE. A further inquiry into the deal was set up in April by the CMA after concerns were raised as to whether the merger might impact the prices of standard variable tariffs (SVTs), the most common and expensive tariff available to UK households. The CMA found that SSE and Npower do not compete closely enough on tariff prices for the merger to warrant further attention. Additionally, households that do choose to switch providers often do not switch between the two firms. Anne Lambert, chair of the CMA's inquiry group, said while the deal was carefully scrutinised, ""our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers"". The deal will take Britain's socalled Big Six providers down to five, as Npower, which is owned by German group Innogy, will combine with SSE to make a new listed entity on the London Stock Exchange. A final decision is due in October."
30-Aug-18,City AM,Global M&A total hits $3 trillion on megadeal boom,"THE VALUE of deals announced globally has hit $3 trillion (£2.3 trillion) already this year - the second fastest sprint to the milestone on record. Only in 2007 did the value of mergers and acquisitions across the world reach $3 trillion earlier in the year. The latest Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence data showed almost 30,000 transactions had already been made in 2018. Among the biggest deals of the year so far has been the long-awaited $26bn merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, sparked by the upgrade to 5G networks. Takeda Pharmaceutical's $62bn acquisition of rare disease specialist Shire, and General Electric's plan to divest $20bn worth of assets from its healthcare unit, also helped global M&A activity hit the $3 trillionmark. Halfway through this year the value of deals was up 64 per cent compared to the same period in 2017. Hernan Cristerna, co-head of Global M&A at JP Morgan Chase, said: ""Companies are moving fast rather than dragging their feet."" It is the fifth consecutive year worldwide mergers and acquisitions activity has exceeded $3 trillion. The total in 2017 hit $3.5 trillion following a flurry of transactions towards the end of the year sparked by Amazon, Facebook and Netflix threatening to muscle into new sectors. Chief executive of investment bank Qatalyst, George Boutros, said that trend had continued into this year. He said: ""The large tech platforms, such as Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, have become very credible competitors to the media and telecom companies, and are certainly creating a lot of pressure on them."" He added that their increased presence had led to a federal judge to approve AT&T's $85.4bn purchase of Time Warner in June. The deal combines the former's paid-TV subscribers with Time Warner's content, which includes HBO, CNN and Warner Bros."

22-Aug-18,City AM,BEST OF THE BROKERS,"15 Aug 16 Aug 17 Aug 20 Aug 21 Aug Keywords Studios is speeding ahead with the acquisition of Gobo, the UK studio behind popular racing games Pure and Miami Street. The deal will give Keywords, a games development outsourcing firm itself, access to some strong customers such as Ubisoft and Amazon Studios, leading many to view the acquisition as extremely positive for the London company. Brokerage Peel Hunt thinks the move is a ""strategic opportunity"" for Keywords as it grows, and so issued an ""add"" rating for the firm with an upgraded target price of 2,100p. OCADO 1,100 P 1,080 1,079.50 1,060 21 Aug 1,040 1,020 15 Aug 16 Aug 17 Aug 20 Aug 21 Aug Online-only supermarket Ocado was yesterday called the ""best in the world for grocery"" by its new Canadian partner Sobey's, where Ocado is set to power home delivery for its chain of stores by spring 2020. Boosted by research and talks conducted with Sobey's, analysts at Peel Hunt reckon the deal will spell good tidings for Ocado. Confidence was voiced in the retailer's ability to transform as technology advances, plus it continues to receive a favourable UK reception. Peel Hunt maintained its ""buy"" rating, with a target price of 1,700p. A revised outlook which puts full-year profits ahead of previous expectations has powered public transport consultancy Tracsis to full steam ahead, after a strong trading update showed positive momentum across all parts of the group. Analysts at Finncap called Tracsis' closing net cash position for the first half of the year ""very strong"", coming in at £22m compared to their £13.4m estimate, which puts it in a solid position to make further acquisitions this year. The brokerage upgraded its target price from 700p to 725p."
17-Aug-18,City AM,Sunny outlook for On the Beach as acquisition signals offline growth,"ONLINE holiday retailer On the Beach has bought a luxury high-street travel agency in a move into the offline market, as the firm announced yesterday that profits are in line with expectations. The £20m acquisition of Classic Collection came amid stable projections for the year ahead, with shares rising more than 15 per cent during yesterday's trading. Speaking about the acquisition of Classic Collection, On the Beach chief executive Simon Cooper said: ""We operate in a market where circa 60 per cent of bookings are made online and we have never addressed a market that books its holiday off line."" Analysts are expecting the UKbased travel company to report adjusted pre-tax profit in the range of £33.5m to £34.2m for the 12 months to the end of September later this year. While rival firms such as Tui Group and Thomas Cook have been hit by the blistering summer heatwave that has kept holidaygoers in the UK, yesterday's expectations signal a resilience in On the Beach's businesses model. Chief financial officer Paul Meehan said: ""Whereas the tour operators, if they don't sell a holiday, they will have a loss... because they still have to pay the supplier and pay for the aircraft, we don't have costs incurred if we don't sell a holiday""."
17-Aug-18,City AM,Price is right for Asda after fifth period of growth,"ASDA continued its streak of growth yesterday with a fifth consecutive rise in same-store sales ahead of its proposed merger with Sainsbury's. The supermarket posted a 2.4 per cent improvement in net sales in its second-quarter results, fuelled by its online business and a 25 per cent jump in sales of its George clothing brand. Enjoying a 12.5 per cent stake in the market, according to Kantar Worldpanel data, below only Tesco and tie-up partner Sainsbury's, CEO Roger Burnley said this is the first quarter Asda has outperformed the market since 2014. ""We remain focused on delivering our strategic priorities and investing in the areas that matter most to our customers - innovation in our own brand, lowering prices and in continuously improving our shopping experience both in store and online,"" he added. While same-store sales only increased by 0.4 per cent, Asda welcomed 285,000 new customers to its brick and mortar outlets and saw digital sales spike by 13.2 per cent. The results are the latest evidence of a turnaround under new management for the retailer, which came under pressure from cut-price rivals Aldi and Lidl while larger players consolidated their positions. That saw Asda fail to post a rise in same-store sales for three years, seeing its market share slip by over two per cent since 2014, according to Kantar Worldpanel data. However, Sainsbury's proposed £12bn merger with Asda, announced in April, would value the firm at over £7bn and grant parent company Walmart a 42 per cent stake in the tie-up. Together the British supermarket brands would command almost £1 in every £3 spent on groceries. Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Walmart, said: ""We're focused on improving the experience in our stores and providing great value for customers through lower prices, especially within our private label offerings."" Walmart recorded its own strongest sales for a decade yesterday, improving comparable sales by 4.5 per cent to achieve revenue of $128bn (£101bn)."

AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said the trend was logical as global mergers and acquisition activity is high generally, but he warned that it could be a cause for concern. ""With global M&A activity running at a pace last seen in 2007, it is logical then PE-backed deals are also at an 11-year high,"" he said. ""Whether this is a good thing remains to be seen, given that 2007 'called the top' so far as global financial markets were concerned and you do tend to see investors - and acquirers - taking more risks than they would normally as a market cycle wears on,"" Mould told City A.M. ""That is, after all, what makes a cycle - animal spirits rise, more risks are taken and eventually too much risk is accepted in the search for reward, leading to trouble. ""It is too early to tell whether this stock market cycle is about to go the way of all others but rampant M&A activity, regardless of who the buyers are, can be one early warning signal to note."" Taylor Wessing private equity practice group partner Ed Waldron said: ""We continue to see a strong pipeline of private equity buyouts and secondaries including in the mid-to-uppermid markets where the firm has a lot of experience. ""While few deals are ever fully UK domestic transactions, the majority of the deals we are seeing at the moment have a pan-European angle and usually with opportunities for further European expansion, particularly through acquisition."""

15-Aug-18,City AM,Insurer Esure to go private in £1.2bn takeover,"3.89% CATHERINE NEILAN @CatNeilan INSURER Esure yesterday agreed a £1.207bn takeover by Bain Capital, heralding it as a ""compelling"" offer that will deliver both strategic benefits and shareholder value. The deal, for 280p per share, will result in the firm going private just five years after its float. Chairman Sir Peter Wood - who owns 31 per cent of the company - will remain in place. Wood said: ""I'm pleased to be announcing this transaction today, because it is a great outcome for shareholders, for the company, and for customers."" ""As a private company and with Bain Capital's backing, Esure will be able to invest behind the innovation required to fully realise the opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""I am pleased to be continuing as chairman and am fully aligned with Bain Capital, who I believe will be a tremendous partner in the next phase of Esure's journey."" Esure hailed the deal as one that ""recognises the value created by Esure's strategy to date and the value that this strategy is expected to generate in future"". The deal came just a day after the insurer revealed it had received a takeover bid after its share price spiked in morning trading. Luca Bassi, a managing director at Bain Capital Europe, added: ""Esure's nimble and focused approach, lean structure and strong use of technology positions it to grow in a changing insurance industry: insurance companies with smarter operations and better technology are best placed to meet customers' needs at competitive prices while delivering profitable growth. ""We are committed to investing capital in the best technology for Esure and believe that this, combined with our experience of growing highly regulated, complex financial services businesses can help Esure thrive. We look forward to partnering with Esure's management team to accelerate its growth."" Esure's share price rose nearly four per cent yesterday to 277.6p, having jumped more than 30 per cent after the deal was announced on Monday. BEHIND THE DEAL Mervyn Metcalf - Dean Street Advisers £ METCALF and fellow managing director Graeme Atkinson led a team from boutique investment bank Dean Street advising Bain Capital on the deal. £ THE DEAL was a ""great example of how the City can work very well through longstanding relationships"", Metcalf said, noting that many of the advisers had worked together on previous transactions. £ WHEN NOT DOING DEALS Metcalf collects contemporary art, although having run out of wall space he is also now a ""collector of storage space"", he said.

15-Aug-18,City AM,House of Fraser and Sports Direct: What happens next?,"THE BIGGEST story of the last few days in the retail world was undoubtedly Sports Direct's acquisition of the struggling House of Fraser, for a reported £90m. Sports Direct's founder Mike Ashley has vowed to keep open the majority of the 59 stores he has bought, and has spoken about how he plans to turn the chain into the ""Harrods of the high street"". I have explored the differing fortunes of both brands a number of times in this column. Looking at House of Fraser first of all, YouGov BrandIndex data indicates that consumer perception of the brand has dropped significantly over the past year, in line with its financial problems. Around this time last year, the retailer's impression score (do you have a positive or negative impression of the brand) was around the 27 mark. However, by early July 2018, this score had decreased to 12. Conversely, Sports Direct was the most improved brand in YouGov's annual global health rankings. However, this may have more to do with the fact that it has managed to avoid the negative headlines that it experienced in 2017. Indeed, while its index score improved by six points, it is still in negative territory (its rating moved from minus 12 to minus six). The difference between the brands is fairly simple: while House of Fraser has been outflanked by nimbler online rivals and failed to establish a clear identity, consumers know what Sports Direct represents. In the case of the sports retailer, people tend to be willing to disregard any objections they may have about the brand's ethics, due to the cheap prices on offer. Observers are now awaiting concrete news on Ashley's reinvention plans for the company. Plans to take House of Fraser upmarket may appear incongruous with the model Sports Direct has established over the years, so implementing this will need a lot of brand positioning work. This is assuming of course, that Ashley decides against simply converting House of Fraser stores into Sports Direct shops. Naturally, making House of Fraser's online offering competitive with greater investment in technology will also be a pre-requisite of any relaunch. £ Stephan Shakespeare is the chief executive of YouGov"
15-Aug-18,City AM,Cignatakeover supported by investor Icahn,"AMERICAN investor Carl Icahn has backed down over Cigna's $67bn (£52.45bn) takeover of online prescription service Express Scripts. The shareholder activist dropped his opposition to the acquisition days after warning shareholders that health insurance company Cigna was ""dramatically overpaying"". Icahn announced he would no longer urge shareholders to vote against the transaction after two proxy advisory firms backed the move. Icahn said: ""In light of the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations in favour of the Cigna/Express Scripts transaction and the significant stockholder overlap between the two companies, we have informed the SEC that we no longer intend to solicit proxies to vote against the transaction."" Last week Icahn warned shareholders that health insurance company Cigna ""is dramatically overpaying for a highly-challenged Express Scripts that is facing existential risks on several fronts."" Cigna slammed his opposition to the transaction as ""innuendoes and false information"". Cigna president and chief executive officer David Cordani said: ""We welcome the favourable recommendations from both Glass Lewis and ISS as momentum continues to build in support of our merger with Express Scripts. ""Their recommendations underscore the significant shareholder value that this transformative merger will deliver in a highly dynamic market environment."" Glass Lewis commented that the merger is an ""attractive opportunity to create a more diverse and integrated business model in the evolving health care services industry which will be better positioned to serve consumers, adapt to competitive and structural challenges, respond to regulatory changes, capitalise on growth opportunities and potentially realise significant incremental cost savings and operational efficiencies"". The takeover decision will be made when shareholders vote at a special meeting on Friday 24 August."

14-Aug-18,City AM,Indie labels ask EU to halt Sony $2.3bn EMI bid,"A GROUP of independent music labels have called on European Union antitrust regulators to halt Sony's $2.3bn (£1.8bn) bid to buy EMI Music Publishing. Impala, an association for independent music companies, said the merger would give Sony too much control over the market. Helen Smith, executive chair of Impala, said independent labels were worried the deal would hand too much power to Sony. ""The market needs big operators, but not when they are allowed to acquire so much power that they start to strangle it and squeeze out the independents who are the ones taking the risks,"" she explained. Impala is concerned the deal will give Sony a full monopoly over the market, as it will negotiate online rights for its publishing and recording catalogues, market its extensive repertoire across labels and selected playlists, and be able to more easily tempt songwriters onto their label with lucrative contracts. It also said the deal will lead to Sony concentrating its energy on selling Anglo-American hits rather than local songs. Impala will put its case to the European Commission this week. ""Blocking seems to be the only outcome,"" Smith concluded. The deal, which was agreed in May, would see Sony, which already holds a 30 per cent stake in EMI, buy a 60 per cent stake from funding firm Mubadala Investment. The acquisition was the first major purchase by Sony's new boss Kenichiro Yoshida, and will hand the company rights to 2.1m songs by musicians including Motown artist Carole King, rappers Drake and Kanye West and singer Sam Smith. In total, Sony will hold the rights to 4.4m tunes."

Earlier this month, flights from Paris Orly to Montreal and Guadeloupe were added to the mix, while flights to New York and Martinique will go live in September. Hodder currently serves as Flybe's chief strategy officer and has also worked with low-cost carriers such as Jetstar in Australia and Asia and VivaAerobus in Mexico.

24-Jul-18,City AM,Kuwaiti fund in $1.7bn North Sea purchase,"WREN House Infrastructure Management, the London-based arm of the Kuwait Investment Authority, has bought a North Sea gas midstream business for a reported $1.7bn (£1.3bn). Wren House announced yesterday it has agreed to acquire private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners' interest in North Sea Midstream Partners (NSMP), which has interests in and operates four gas transportation and processing assets in and around the North Sea. These include a 67 per cent interest in the Shetland Island Regional Gas Export System pipeline, which transports gas from the west of Shetland basin and a 100 per cent interest in the Frigg UK pipeline. Wren House reportedly fought off bids from JP Morgan, Blackstone, and private equity fund KKR to buy NSMP. ""Wren House was bidding against some very big players and they simply offered the best terms,"" a source told Reuters. Other infrastructure investments Wren House has made in the UK include Associated British Ports, London City Airport and Thames Water. Managing director of Wren House Hakim Drissi Kaitouni said: ""We are excited to continue building on the foundations set by ArcLight and are pleased to support NSMP as it continues to deliver the highest level of service to its customers, whose needs are expected to rapidly grow driven by positive production outlook and new development activities."" NSMP's chief executive Andy Heppel said: ""The combination of NSMP's great base business with Wren House's financial expertise and commitment to operational excellence will be the trigger for continued development of the NSMP infrastructure in the North Sea."" The transaction is expected to close in 2018, the terms of the deal were not disclosed.

23-Jul-18,City AM,Airbus chief eyes pan-European military merger to form US rival,"THE CHIEF executive of aerospace and defence giant Airbus said he is open to building a European megamerger that would create a military aircraft company with the strength to compete with the US. Tom Enders said it was time to ""seriously look at consolidating and coalescing efforts"" into forming one body, the Sunday Times revealed yesterday. The news comes after rival firm BAE Systems called for help to manufacture its designs for a new jet fighter last week, in a £10bn-plus project which so far has received just £2bn from the Ministry of Defence. Airbus attempted a merger with BAE in 2012 to the tune of £34bn, but it was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel over fears of Airbus expanding too heavily into the defence industry. The proposal would see the military aircraft divisions of Airbus, BAE, France's Dassault, Sweden's Saab and Italy's Leonardo combined to form one effort. ""There's no room for three different programmes, not even for two,"" Enders added. ""If you look at how the world develops, it makes a lot of sense, irrespective of political divisions we might have in Europe, that the major industrial forces of the continent work together."""
23-Jul-18,City AM,IWG wins more time for suitors to make offers,"OFFICE space provider IWG has successfully sought an extension from the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers to allow more time for three potential suitors to make firm commitments to buy out the company. Originally TDR Capital, Terra Firma and Starwood Capital had until 5pm on Saturday to make their intentions known, but this deadline has now been pushed back until 7 August. IWG said ""having considered the proposals received and based on discussions to date,"" it was seeking an extension. IWG said the extension excluded fourth suitor Prime Opportunities. IWG has already rebuffed a previous all-cash offer valuing the company at £2.5bn made jointly by two other firms that are no longer part of the process. The current market cap of IWG is £2.7bn. The UK-based company provides clients with serviced offices, meeting rooms, and videoconferencing on a contract basis across more than 100 countries. It has attracted substantial attention from buyers seeking access to the lucrative flexible office sector in recent months. The offer comes in the wake of the rapid expansion of American rival WeWork, which was only founded eight years ago but is now valued at just over £15bn and is central London's largest corporate office occupier. IWG has had a less fortuitous time recently, blaming Brexit and global ""disruption"" from natural disasters earlier in the year for a 14 per cent slump in pre-tax profits on the previous year to £149m. However, its share price has climbed more than 30 per cent since May since it was announced that several potential bidders had come forward. The private equity firms hope their buyout, by taking the company away from the short-term scrutiny of public ownership, will provide more time for IWG's investments to become lucrative, as office space typically takes a number of years to reach maximum profitability."

10-Jul-18,City AM,Chinese bid for Northern Aerospace fails,"CHINESE takeover attempts to buy a British defence company have fallen through, according to UK private equity firm Better Capital. Approval has not been given for aircraft parts maker Northern Aerospace to be purchased by Derbybased Gardner Aerospace, a subsidiary of Chinese aerospace and mining firm Shaanxi Ligeance Mineral Resources. Fears around Chinese government levels of access to sensitive information put the £44m deal back on hold last month, and the UK's competition regulator has denied approval for the sale to go through. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which now has until 13 July to submit a report on the competition and national security aspects of the proposed deal, launched a probe into the potential takeover in June. In an update yesterday Better Capital said: ""Permission to complete the sale was not obtained from the Competition and Markets Authority by the revised contractual deadline, despite requests for such permission by both parties. ""Accordingly the proposed transaction has lapsed."" Northern Aerospace, which is based in County Durham and employs around 600 people, was set to be sold until opposition last month from business secretary Greg Clark, who allegedly stalled the selling of Northern Aerospace on the urgent advice of defence secretary Gavin Williamson. Germany, the US and Canada are among a number of western countries which have recently made high-profile takeover blocks as a result of security concerns around a string of acquisition attempts by Chinese companies across the world."

6-Jul-18,City AM,Magic circle law firms boosted by M&A boom,"MAGIC circle law firms Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Allen & Overy (A&O) have announced strong results as they benefit from a global mergers & acquisitions (M&A) boom. Freshfields had a particularly good year, increasing its profit per equity (PEP) 12 per cent to £1.73m and revenue by five per cent to £1.40bn. The figures mark a return to form for the firm, which posted poor numbers in 2017, with revenue flat and profit falling despite currency movements that flattered its results. A&O said yesterday that it had grown revenue four per cent to £1.57bn, while profit grew three per cent to £690m. In the year to 30 April, PEP increased four per cent to £1.64m, from £1.51m the previous year. In 2016-17 the firm had a standout year, growing revenue 16 per cent and PEP 26 per cent, although those results were influenced by the weakness of the pound. The firm said its corporate M&A practice had its busiest year on record, with London and western Europe particular high points. A&O's managing partner Andrew Ballheimer said: ""Last year was outstanding, although that growth was fuelled in part by currency movements. This year, we have grown again, and if you take a two-year view it is growth of £260m or 20 per cent, and that is FX-neutral."" Freshfields managing partner Stephan Eilers said it was a ""strong performance in terms of revenue and profitability in all regions and all sectors of the firm."" Eilers said the firm's performance was driven by its succesful private equity practice, a stronger US business and a good performance in M&A - particularly in the technology, media and telecoms sector."
6-Jul-18,City AM,Sorrell row with WPP escalates over Dutch bid,"FTSE AD giant WPP yesterday claimed it has been considering a takeover of Dutch agency MediaMonks since November 2017, as it described a rival bid from former boss Sir Martin Sorrell as ""unlawful"". A letter sent by WPP's lawyers to Sorrell suggested the competing bid from his new marketing venture S4 was a ""diversion of a maturing business opportunity for WPP"". The company says Sorrell was ""heavily engaged"" in talks with the Dutch firm's management while he was chief exective of WPP, and even attended a meeting with them in the Netherlands. WPP's letter also warned Sorrell that he risked losing £20m in shares if S4 pursued its interest in MediaMonks. Although Sorrell did not sign a noncompete agreement when he left the company, he agreed to other confidentiality undertakings, which WPP says he risks breaching through his bid for the agency. Sky News yesterday said Lewis Silkin, the law firm representing Sorrell, is disputing the claims and has asked WPP to provide evidence of the alleged meetings and internal discussions regarding MediaMonks. The news outlet said a source close to Sorrell explained he was ""connected"" to a potential bid through private equity firm Inflexion. A spokesperson for Sorrell shrugged off the claims. ""This appears to be an attempt to muddy the waters,"" they said. ""Sir Martin, his lawyers, his senior legal counsel, and his fellow investors are very relaxed."" Speaking at Cannes in June, Sorrell said the ""peanut"" sized S4 did not want to compete with WPP. ""Although it does occur to me that some people have peanut allergies,"" he added. The news follows claims that Sorrell had raised £1bn in the City to fund acquisitions to grow S4. A WPP spokesperson declined to comment last night."
3-Jul-18,City AM,THE BOTTOM LINE,"THE CITY'S response to Tesco's surprise announcement yesterday was remarkably united. Analysts immediately drilled down to three factors influencing the tie-up with Carrefour: the proposed merger between Sainsbury's and Asda, the growing threat of the discounters, and Brexit. The strategic alliance is widely seen as a sensible move to improve buying prices for some of the core products sold by both supermarkets. But there was more cynicism when it came to the claim that it will result in lower prices for customers, with Michael van Dulken of Accendo Markets perceiving the move as a bid to protect already ""wafer thin"" margins. But some price reductions will be necessary if both retailers are to retain market share in the face of competition from Aldi and Lidl. Meanwhile the combination of Sainsbury's and Asda poses another threat, knocking Tesco off its top spot in the UK's grocery market as well as creating a behemoth of buying. All things considered, Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown concluded that a price war is now looming in the UK supermarket sector: great news for consumers, risky for shareholders. Perhaps that is why shares in Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrison's all ended the day lower yesterday. Of course, all this could be rendered irrelevant by an unexpected Brexit outcome. Several industry observers yesterday theorised that Tesco's entente cordiale with Carrefour was an attempt to protect supply chains from upheaval. Only time will tell if it works."
3-Jul-18,City AM,Micro Focus sells subsidiary firm for $2.5bn,"1.51% SOFTWARE provider and IT management consultancy Micro Focus yesterday said it will sell its Suse open source subsidiary for $2.53bn (£1.93bn) to Swedish private equity house EQT, giving its share price a boost. Suse is worth almost one-third of Micro Focus's business, acquired by the company as part of an all-share purchase of Attachmate for $2.35bn in September 2014. Used by banks, universities and companies like Daimler, Total and Air India, the subsidiary generated revenue of $303m in the year ending April 2017, with an adjusted operating profit of $98.7m. After later buying up Hewlett Packard Entreprise's software unit for $8.8bn last year, Micro Focus has since been struggling to handle the weight, and is planning on using the proceeds of yesterday's sale to reduce its debt. The news prompted a rise in Micro Focus' share price during trading yesterday, with shares closing up 1.51 per cent. It follows a sharp drop in value in March, as investors became wary of Micro Focus' expansion tactics. The company shed more than half its market value as revenues shifted into decline and its chief executive left his post."
3-Jul-18,City AM,M&A offers for EU targets rise to 11-year high,"A SPATE of mega-deals spurred an M&A shopping spree as firms targeted a higher volume of European acquisitions than at any point since 2007's record year, new figures show. European target mergers and acquisitions (M&A) climbed to $770.4bn (£587bn) in first half of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data published yesterday. The surge in bids for EU firms pushed the half-year total above the full-year volume for European targets in five of the last 10 years. Unilever's share reunification is technically the largest deal of the year so far with a European target, with a notional price tag of $90.6bn. Yet even without the restructuring the year-to date performance remains the strongest since 2007 year-to-date - the year before the global financial crisis laid waste to M&A volumes across Western economies. Other large offers include Takeda's massive takeover of the UK's Shire, plus offers for UK satellite broadcaster Sky as part of the sale of Fox assets by Rupert Murdoch. Media and entertianment, including the offers for Sky and Vodafone's purchase of Unitymedia from Liberty Global, was the biggest sector, accounting for 20 per cent of volumes despite representing only eight per cent of offer numbers. Acquisitions by the UK, US, Netherlands, Japan and Italy add up to $518.5bn in total, up more than 240 per cent from the same point last year. The spree of dealmaking comes after a sustained period of strong growth across Europe, with many analysts describing the market as exhibiting late-cycle dynamics."
28-Jun-18,City AM,Former Barclays boss Diamond invests in broker,"FORMER Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond took a stake yesterday in a French brokerage in a bet that the business will prosper in the aftermath of new European regulations. Diamond's investment vehicle Atlas Merchant Capital (AMC) said it had agreed to acquire a 27.73 per cent stake in Kepler Cheuvreux from Blackfin Capital Partners while Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild acquired an eight per cent stake. AMC said the move was based on the strength of Kepler's research business which it expects to thrive in the wake of the Mifid II (the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) regulations which came into force in January. One of the effects of Mifid II is that asset managers can no longer receive broker research for free in return for the commission they pay. Matthew Hansen, the head of UK and Europe for AMC, said: ""The decision to invest in Kepler Cheuvreux was based on an analysis of their market leading positions in pan-European research, advisory and execution. In research, which is the cornerstone of their business, they have the largest research coverage in mainland Europe and are prospering in the post Mifid II research environment."" Diamond said Kepler Cheuvreux ""has a very good management team, focused on services where they excel and a pan-European client base"". ""My partners and I believe that by combining these strengths with AMC's operating experience, the company has very exciting growth prospects."" The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, should be finalised by the end of September. No deal value was disclosed. Kepler may float in the next five years, its boss Laurent Quirin said."
27-Jun-18,City AM,AT&T boosts ad arm with $1.6bn AppNexus deal,"MEDIA giant AT&T has agreed to buy advertising software company AppNexus in a tie-up worth around $1.6bn (£1.2bn). AT&T said the takeover would help it invest in the growth of its advertising platform and consolidate in advanced TV advertising. It follows AT&T's mega merger with Time Warner being approved earlier this month, which will allow the company to advertise with the TV channels it acquired through the deal. The Wall Street Journal reported the deal to be worth around $1.6bn. The merger will bring across App-Nexus' team of 400 software engineers and product managers when it is joined with AT&T's advertising and analytics division. AppNexus is a cloud-based software company which optimises online ad campaigns for clients. ""Ad tech unites real-time analytics and technology with our premium TV and video content,"" said AT&T advertising and analytics boss Brian Lesser. ""So, we went out and found the strongest player in the space. ""AppNexus has scale of infrastructure, advanced technology and diverse talent. The combination of AT&T advertising & analytics and App-Nexus will help deliver a world-class advertising platform that provides brands and publishers a new and innovative way to reach consumers in the marketplace today."" The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, and is subject to customary closing conditions. Brian O'Kelley, chief executive of AppNexus, said: ""Combining AT&T's incredible assets with our technology, we will help brands and marketers power new advertising experiences for consumers. It's what the market is asking for, and together we're poised to deliver it."""
26-Jun-18,City AM,Nielsen and Ebiquity media merger faces in-depth probe from watchdog,"A MEDIA intelligence merger that will see Ebiquity sell its advertising intelligence division to rival Nielsen will face an in-depth investigation from the competition watchdog, the regulator announced yesterday. In February, Nielsen and Ebiquity, which monitor the advertising habits of UK companies, announced an intention to complete the deal. But earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) raised concerns, as both companies are the only suppliers of detailed advertising intelligence across a range of UK media. It argued that as the two companies were each other's closest competitor in the market, and faced limited competition from other suppliers internationally, the deal could raise competition concerns. Nielsen and Ebiquity were given a chance to offer acceptable undertakings to address these issues, but as they did not propose a satisfactory compromise, the CMA has referred the merger to an indepth investigation. Ebiquity chief exec Michael Karg said: ""We continue to believe the transaction will deliver substantial benefits for all stakeholders. A Phase 2 referral is not uncommon and together with Nielsen, we continue to work closely with the CMA towards a successful conclusion."" The process will take around 24 weeks to complete."
25-Jun-18,City AM,Internationalist' dealmakers buck M&A trend,"THE UK M&A market bucked a global trend of poor performance and decline for the second quarter of 2018, thanks to a high volume of firms buying overseas. Data by Willis Towers Watson, in partnership with Cass Business School, revealed that the global M&A market recorded its worst quarter in 10 years based on share price performance. While the overall volume of mergers and acquisitions remains on track to beat the post-crisis high of 2015, dealmakers ""struggled to add value"" and underperformed the index by 6.1 percentage points in the last three months. UK acquirers, on the other hand, managed to perform 10.6 percentage points above the index for the last six months. Jana Mercereau, head of corporate mergers and acquisitions for Great Britain, said: ""The increasing focus on domestic markets will intensify the competition for an ever-shrinking pool of targets, making it harder to deliver a deal without harming shareholder value. British companies have instead benefited from taking a more internationalist stance by targeting foreign businesses, despite Brexit uncertainties still looming large and the weakness of the pound."" Sixty-three per cent of UK dealmakers spent the first half buying overseas companies while their North American counterparts did overseas deals that represented just 13 per cent of acquisitions made so far this year, down from 20 per cent the previous year. She added: ""The deal making bonanza seen so far in 2018 is likely to continue as long as solid economics, low interest rates and supportive credit markets persist. ""Despite the optimism and appetite for pursuing growth through M&A, the poor performances that have followed completed deals suggest investors right now have very little margin of error. As M&A activity accelerates towards its peak, the importance of discipline and strong diligence grows so companies can mitigate risks and avoid the mistake of paying over the odds."""
25-Jun-18,City AM,Guy Hands joins bidding war for office space firm,"LONDON-LISTED office space provider IWG has received an approach from private equity firm Terra Firma Investments over a possible takeover of the company, it emerged over the weekend. The FTSE 250 office provider behind Regus confirmed that it had been contacted by the investor regarding a potential all-cash offer after it emerged that top financier Guy Hands' Terra Firma was the latest company to join the bidding war for the $3.8bn (£2.9bn) company. IWG said: ""The board is evaluating the Terra Firma offer with its financial advisers and shareholders will be updated in due course."" Another private equity fund, TDR Capital, and real estate investment groups Starwood Capital and Prime Opportunities are battling to take control of the company. The business has offices in almost 3,300 locations worldwide, amounting to 52m square feet in more than 110 countries. IWG has been courting a number of suitors recently after a takeover attempt from Onex and Brookfield Asset Management collapsed in February. It follows a $4.4bn investment from Japanese fund SoftBank into workspace competitor Wework, giving it a market valuation of $20bn. IWG was founded in 1989 by Mark Dixon, who remains its chief executive and holds a 25.4 per cent stake in the company."
25-Jun-18,City AM,Former Stobart boss wanted trucking merger,"FORMER Stobart Group chief executive Andrew Tinkler drew up plans to mergeStobart Group with trucking business Eddie Stobart Logistics, which it span off in 2014. The merger, which was discussed as recently as last month, would have created a business with a market capitalisation of £1.7bn. Tinkler is trying to unseat the chair of the Stobart Group Iain Ferguson, calling for Edinburgh Woollen Mill boss Philip Day to replace him. The Stobart Group board has accused Tinkler of trying to parachute a friend and ally into the role of chair. Tinkler said he has only met Day a few times, but emails between the pair seem to show a close relationship. In emails from last month seen by City A.M., Tinkler asked Day for his input on the proposed merger, dubbed ""project park"". The pair discussed the merger plans, spoke about meeting at Day's castle in Cumbria and bantered about boats and blackjack tables. Jaeger-owner Day also invited Tinkler to a future press day at the luxury brand - ""you have to come to one, good fun,"" he wrote. In another email Day wrote: ""Just read project park and its looks very interesting, can see why you would want to combine! Win\Win. ""We can chat tomorrow night when we meet up."" Day signed off the email: ""Take care mate and speak soon"". A spokesperson for Tinkler said: ""In fulfilling his board appointed role Andrew generated numerous ideas at Stobart Capital to enhance shareholder value for the group,"" they said. Tinkler was fired from Stobart's board this month, with Stobart accusing him of making unlawful use of company information and Tinkler accusing the company of defamation."
21-Jun-18,City AM,Asda and Sainsbury's bosses grilled over deal,"THE CHAIR of a select committee yesterday told Asda's boss to ""get real"" and stop talking ""baloney"" in a grilling over the supermarket's merger with Sainsbury's. Asda's Roger Burnley and Sainsbury's boss Mike Coupe appeared in front of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) committee, which has launched an inquiry into the merger. They faced questions on suppliers, staff pay and cost savings. Chair Neil Parish accused both Burnley and Coupe of talking ""baloney"" over market share figures and said that the cost of the merger would end up falling on the suppliers to the two supermarkets. ""It's a cut-throat world out there and we know whose throat you're going to cut,"" he said. He also said he expected Sainsbury's and Asda to eventually become one supermarket. Burnley denied this, saying that Asda and Sainsbury's would remain ""fiercely"" independent brands. However he also said that he could not imagine there being a ""vast disparity"" between the pay of Sainsbury's and Asda workers, after concerns were raised that Asda's staff are paid less. Burnley said that he could benefit from the deal if Wal-Mart bases his bonus on the success of the merger. But Coupe insisted to the committee that he would ""stand to gain nothing"" from the deal. After the meeting, Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, who has been leading opposition to changes to Sainsbury's contracts, asked Coupe about staff pay. ""I just wondered how you were able to justify that at the same time as taking a pay increase of over £425,000?"" she said as he exited the committee room. The Competition and Markets Authority said in May it was kicking off its scrutiny of the proposed merger between the supermarket giants. Sainsbury's announced in April that it intended to merge with Asda, which is currently owned by Wal-Mart in the US. The two have said a deal will mean grocery prices across both chains will fall, and that a merger would not lead to store closures and job losses."
19-Jun-18,City AM,Watchdog probe on Rentokil and Fidessa mergers,"THE UK'S competition watchdog yesterday raised concerns over two major City mergers, putting the future of the deals in doubt. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) questioned FTSE 100-listed Rentokil Initial's proposed acquisition of Cannon due to fears that it could limit competition for washroom supplies and maintenance. Both firms operate in the area of installation and servicing of air sanitisers, waste disposal units and soap dispensers. The two now have until 25 June to address the CMA's concerns. If the watchdog is not appeased, the merger will be referred for an in-depth probe. Rentokil's acquisition of Cannon completed early this year, adding a projected £77m to Rentokil's global hygiene revenues. It is one in a string of acquisitions by the services giant. In 2016, the firm acquired 41 companies for £107m, and in 2017 another 41 were added to the portfolio for £280m. Meanwhile, the CMA also said it is looking into whether Ion Investment Group's last-minute £1.5bn bid for software company Fidessa could cause competition concerns. The probe is at an early stage, with comments invited until 2 July. Fidessa had previously recommended that shareholders accept a £1.4bn offer from Swiss rival Temenos, but changed its allegiance to recommend Ion's bid as it came in just over two hours before the deadline. Fidessa investors will receive a total price per share of 3,950p from the Ion offer, after factoring in a final dividend for 2017. Ion's offer came in at a 48.6 per cent premium to Fidessa's share price at the time of the bid, which now sits at 3,860p."
12-Jun-18,City AM,Henderson Park acquires Athene Place for £101m,"REAL ESTATE investment group Henderson Park yesterday said it had acquired office building Athene Place in London from Commerz Real, a subsidiary of Germany's Commerzbank. The £101m sale was financed with senior debt provided by Blackstone Real Estate Debt Strategies. Athene Place is a 147,000 square foot office building in central London opposite Goldman Sachs' new European headquarters. Located on the Central, District, and Circle lines, the building will also eventually have access to the new Elizabeth line. The deal marks Henderson Park's 11th investment and its first in the London office market. Former Goldman Sachs executive and Henderson Park founder Nick Weber said: ""Athene Place is an exceptional building which has already begun to attract interest from tenants and which we believe has huge potential in one of London's fastest-moving and best connected sub-markets. ""This investment underscores our firm belief in the demand for institutional quality central London office space, driven by London's pre-eminent position as a centre for international business. ""We're excited to partner with Endurance Land to deliver a high quality asset for this part of the City."" The purchase follows Henderson Park's acquisition of Hilton Metropole hotels in London and Birmingham last year for around £500m."
12-Jun-18,City AM,KKR to acquire Envision health group for £4bn,"AMERICAN investment firm KKR yesterday announced it is acquiring US medical services provider Envision Healthcare for $5.57bn (£4.16bn). The deal represents the latest push into the healthcare sector for KKR, which already owns Envision AMR, the largest US provider of ambulance services. The firm bought online medical company WebMD for about $2.8bn last year. KKR sealed the latest deal with Envision for $46 per share - a premium of 5.4 per cent to Envision's last close on Friday. Including debt, the deal is valued at $9.9bn. The Envision deal comes just a few weeks after KKR announced it would be purchasing business software company BMC Software for $8.5bn. James D Shelton, Envision's lead independent director, said: ""After conducting a robust review of the business and competitive landscape, the company's opportunities and challenges, and the strategic and financial alternatives available to the company, the board unanimously believes that this transaction will deliver the most value to Envision's shareholders."" Christopher Holden, Envision's president and CEO said: ""Envision's leadership team - including both the board and management - have been singularly focused on driving value for our shareholders and have taken decisive action in furtherance of that goal, including the implementation of a comprehensive operational improvement plan and a robust review of strategic alternatives."" Envision said the deal marks an end to its efforts to find strategic alternatives, which the company launched last year."
12-Jun-18,City AM,Inmarsat soars on Echostar takeover offer,"SHARES in satellite giant Inmarsat rocketed more than 12 per cent yesterday, after the company confirmed on Friday that it had received a takeover offer from Echostar. Last week, the group said it had received ""a highly preliminary and indicative non-binding proposal from Echostar Corporation"", which it then rejected. Inmarsat said the offer had ""very significantly undervalued"" the company and its standalone prospects, with the board saying they remained highly confident in the independent strategy being pursued by the company. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable yesterday warned the Inmarsattakeover approach needed to be watched, comparing it to Melrose's GKNtakeover and the SoftBank-Arm acquisition. The share surge marked a welcome change for investors after a slump last month prompted by the breaking up of the company's global maritime distress signals monopoly. The International Maritime Organization's Maritime Safety Committee certified US-based Iridium Communications to provide Global Maritime Distress Safety System services. Last month, executive pay at the company was in focus, with shareholders hitting out at proposals that were ""too closely geared towards short-term awards"". Some 58.49 per cent voted against Inmarsat's remuneration report at its annual general meeting. CEO Rupert Pearce took over £1.9m in 2017 with finance chief Tony Bates paid £1.5m. Their pay fell from £2.3m and £1.8m respectively in 2016."
12-Jun-18,City AM,Takeda group plots to stop Shire purchase,"A GROUP of Takeda shareholders is working to block its $62bn (£46.4bn) acquisition of Shire, Reuters reported yesterday. Japanese drug company Takeda is holding a shareholder meeting later this year to approve an issue of new stock to help fund the deal for London-listed Shire. A 130-member group of ex-Takeda employees holds one per cent of the company's shares but hopes to rally the third of shareholders it will need to block the issuance. Last year the same group tried to stop the appointment of outgoing chair Yasuchika Hasegawa to an advisory position at the company. Its proposal was defeated at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) but it did gain 30.5 per cent of the vote. It also introduced a proposal for this month's AGM arguing that deals worth more than ¥1 trillion (£7bn) should be put to a shareholder vote. The motion will need the approval of more than two-thirds of voters at the meeting to pass. Last week Takeda announced it had entered a $7.5bn term loan credit agreement to fund the Shire merger. Shares at Takeda have fallen more than 20 per cent since it first said it was considering bidding for Shire. Shire and Takeda agreed to terms in May after a long pursuit by the Japanese company. Takeda made four unsuccessful offers before Shire recommended shareholders accept its fifth offer. Shire shareholders received $30.33 in cash and 0.839 new Takeda shares. Takeda's sliding share price could hit Shire shareholders in the pocket since a large proportion of the payment for the deal is in Takeda shares."
11-Jun-18,City AM,Latest rules on mergers could flood regulator,"THE UK'S competition authorities could be severely stretched by new merger rules that come into force today, said a partner at a top law firm. The new regime could lead to a 156 per cent increase in the number of deals that face scrutiny, adding to the burden on competition regulators that already face an expected increase in their work because of Brexit. Samantha Mobley, London head of competition and trade at law firm Baker McKenzie, said: ""The new thresholds are likely to lead to a greater number of merger notifications to the UK competition authority. This will have a significant impact on resources, at a time when the competition authority is already predicting that its mergers workload will increase by 50 per cent as a result of Brexit."" The new rules strengthen the government's power to review mergers on the grounds of national security. The legislation amends the UK's merger control filing threshold, to targets with revenue exceeding £1m instead of £70m in three areas: military and dual use, quantum technology and multi-purpose computing hardware. Baker McKenzie said under the new laws at least 91 per cent of deals in these sectors will be scrutinised, up from 35 per cent before the change. The firm said the value of the additional deals that will be examined is equivalent to £1.35bn. Mobley said: ""The regulatory burden of doing deals is increasing and so are the challenges for global businesses. While the UK government will now have more power to review cross-border deals, there needs to be a balance between continuing to encourage foreign investment and protecting national security interests."""
6-Jun-18,City AM,Philips to buy cardiac imaging firm EPD Solutions in a €250m merger,"DUTCH technology company Royal Philips yesterday said it will buy EPD Solutions, a manufacturer of systems used to treat patients with heart rhythm disorders for €250m (£219m). Philips, which is a global leader in healthcare technology, will pay €250m in cash up front followed by payments with an estimated value of about €210m if milestones are met. EPD specialises in making cardiac imaging and navigation systems to create 3D models of the heart and cardiovascular system to improve treatment of patients suffering from cardiac arrhythmias. Frans van Houten, chief executive of Philips, said: ""The technology has the potential to address the key unmet need of real-time therapy assessment, which is one of the more significant limitations of the current standard of care. ""This acquisition will strengthen our ability to improve the lives of arrhythmia patients, and is entirely consistent with our strategic plan to broaden our image-guided therapy solutions portfolio and drive longterm profitable growth for Philips."" Philips, which already has an imaging system platform called Azurion, will combine its expertise with the EPD systems which have been installed in several hospitals across Europe and is currently being reviewed by the FDA in the US. Shlomo Ben-Haim, founder and chairman of EPD, said: ""I am convinced that as part of Philips, we will be able to grow EPD and help many electrophysiologists and patients worldwide, as we aim to reduce procedure costs, simplify navigation and treatment, and ultimately improve procedure efficacy."""
6-Jun-18,City AM,Takeover battle looms as government gives green light to Sky-Fox merger,"CULTURE secretary Matt Hancock said yesterday that a mega-merger between Sky and Fox could go ahead so long as Sky News is divested to Disney or another firm. If an ""acceptable form of remedy"" can be found, the minister said he would wave the deal through. Hancock said he agreed with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that there were concerns about the ""potential erosion of Sky News' editorial independence, which could in turn lead to a reduction in the diversity of viewpoints available to and consumed by the public"". He also raised a flag over the ""possibility of an increased influence of the Murdoch Family Trust over public opinion and the UK's political agenda"". Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox launched a 1,075p-a-share bid to buy all of Sky in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by politicians and regulators who fear it could give him too much sway when combined with his newspaper interests. US giant Comcast took advantage of the delay to make its own move on Sky, with a 1,250p-a-share bid in April, trumping the Fox offer. Hancock also told MPs yesterday that he had received no further representations on the proposed Comcastmerger, and confirmed he would not be issuing an intervention notice. Shares in 21st Century Fox closed up 0.8 per cent last night at $38.74."
5-Jun-18,City AM,French bank Societe settles legal actions,"FRENCH banking giant Societe Generale yesterday announced the settlement of US and French legal actions for allegedly rigging the Libor benchmark rate and for questionable transactions with Libyan parties, as reported interest in a merger from Italy's Unicredit boosted demand for shares. The settlements will be within the €1bn (£870m) provisions the bank has already set aside for the two probes, SocGen said, subject to judicial approval. In March SocGen's deputy chief executive was forced to quit the bank, with the investigation into rigging of the money market benchmark London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) reportedly a key reason for his departure. On the Libyan front SocGen last year paid €963m to the Libyan Investment Authority, which had accused it of corruption. The settlements remove an obstacle to the reported plans by Italian banking group Unicredit to pursue a merger with SocGen to create a European banking behemoth. Analysts agreed on the logic for the move, reported by the Financial Times, but questioned whether a merger could happen in the near term. The report ""does not come completely out of the blue"", according to analysts at Jefferies investment bank. However, political instability in Italy and regulatory unease over the size of the two banks are ""a significant hurdle to deliver an attractive deal"". Both banks are global systemically important banks, meaning authorities are likely to scrutinise any merger deal closely for risks to the European financial system."
5-Jun-18,City AM,Payments giants Nets and Concardis in multi-billion pound mega-merger,"AFTER a flurry of private equity interest in the sector, two of Europe's largest payments businesses - Nets and Concardis - will merge in a multi-billion pound deal. The two firms said yesterday at the fintech conference Money 20/20 that Concardis would merge with Nets to form a company with €1.3bn (£1.1bn) of annual net revenue. Private equity giants Advent and Bain, who own Germany-based Concardis, will swap their holdings in Concardis for Nets shares. Their peer Hellman & Friedman, which backs the Scandinaviaheadquartered Nets, will see its holding diluted. ""We want to shape the ongoing consolidation in the European payments industry and further drive our pan-European expansion,"" said Nets' CEO Bo Nilsson. ""Germany offers attractive growth potential due to market size, consumer spending and the fact that around 75 per cent of all payment transactions are still cash-based."" Nilsson will lead the combined group, while Robert Hoffman will continue at the helm of Concardis reporting directly to him. The two firms will retain their respective brands. Advent and Bain formerly owned Nets as well as Concardis, before floating the business in 2016. Hellman & Friedman took it private again earlier this year, though Advent and Bain remained minority investors which likely helped to usher the merger through. Payments companies have been forced to consolidate, as increased regulation has spurred them to invest in compliance. Worldline bought Switzerland's Six Payment Services in May, and London-based fintech investor Anacap bought Heidelpay last year."
5-Jun-18,City AM,DS Smith targets Spanish rival in £1.5bn takeover,"585 580 575 570 565 560 555 550 SHARES in FTSE 100 packaging company DS Smith hit an all-time high yesterday after it revealed a that a Spanish-listed rival was the latest addition to its buying streak. The offer for Europac values the entire share capital at €1.7bn (£1.5bn), with an implied enterprise value of €1.9bn. The business is 42 per cent family owned, but the board has already indicated its interest in the bid. Shares in DS Smith hit a high of 583p following the announcement, before closing at 579.2p. It has received pledges from almost 59 per cent of Europac shareholders to accept the takeover, including the executive chair and executive vice chair. DS Smith said yesterday the acquisition will give the enlarged company an enhanced offer in a key region and stronger supply chain. Joshua Mahoney, a market analyst at IG, said the rise of home delivery provided extensive opportunities for the combined companies. ""With internet shopping continuing to take prominence over physical sales, demand for packaging is only likely to grow, meaning the £43m worth of synergies laid out for this deal could only be the beginning,"" he said. It comes just a few weeks after the company announced its bid for an American corrugated card firm. DS SMITH 585 P580 575 579.20 570 4 June 565 560 555 550 29May 30 May 31May 1June 4 June"
4-Jun-18,City AM,CYBG ups offer to merge with Virgin Money,"THE OWNER of Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks CYBG has tabled a revised offer to merge with Virgin Money and form a challenger worth £4bn. The offer was confirmed in a joint statement from the two companies last night, who added that they had reached an agreement with the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers to extend the deadline on a takeover decision to 18 June. Previously, CYBG had been required by takeover law to make a firm offer of intent before 5pm today. Both companies said they believed the deal would create the UK's ""first national banking competitor"", offerring both personal and SME customers an ""enhanced alternative to the incumbent banks."" News of CYBG's interest in Virgin Money originally surfaced at the start of May when the firm made a preliminary approach valuing the company at £1.6bn, with an offer of 1.1297 of its shares for each Virgin Money share. The new bid offers 1.2125 new CYBG shares for every Virgin share, also valuing the company at around £1.6bn, giving Virgin Money shareholders 38 per cent ownership of the combined group. Virgin Money's board noted that the second offer was a seven per cent increase on the exchange rate of CYBG's offering last month. Both lenders said they recognised: ""the potential for accelerated value creation"" through the merger of the two groups. Earlier yesterday Sky News reported the news that CYBG had put in a higher bid, quoting sources who said the two sides were holding ""positive discussions"". If the companies decide to merge, it would create a personal and SME banking group with 6m customers and a £70bn balance sheet."
4-Jun-18,City AM,Alteri closes in on troubled Poundworld,"BUDGET retailer Poundworld is close to a rescue deal with private equity buyout fund Alteri Investors, in a move which could kick off a major reorganisation of the company. Alteri, which is backed by Apollo Management, is finalising terms of a takeover according to reports by Sky News over the weekend. The deal is set to involve a nominal sum being paid for Poundworld to TPG, its current owner, and creditors. But the takeover is not expected to halt the plans to close as many as 100 stores. Once Alteri takes control it is expected to immediately launch the restructuring programme, the latest in a series of company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). Some 1,500 of Poundworld's 5,300 staff are likely to lose their jobs as a result of the process, which will be overseen by Deloitte. This will add to thousands of closures on the high street so far this year, putting 2018 on course to be the worst year for closures since 2008. It is the second time this year that a company backed by private equity firm TPG Capital has turned to a CVA, after restaurant chain Prezzo passed plans to close nearly 100 sites. House of Fraser is also on course to slash its portfolio, after announcing its own CVA. This is expected to launch in the next two weeks. Meanwhile this week saw the approval of two more: Mothercare and Carluccio's. But there are signs that the wave of CVAs is beginning to cause tension in the wider retail industry, with Next demanding rent cuts on par with its struggling neighbours and M&S joins the battle against rising high street rents."
4-Jun-18,City AM,Bayer launches cash call to fund Monsanto deal,"BAYER launched a €6bn (£5.24bn) rights issue yesterday, a cornerstone of the financing package for its planned $62.5bn (£46.8bn) takeover of seeds maker Monsanto. Bayer last week won US approval for the Monsantotakeover, clearing a major hurdle for a deal that will create by far the largest seeds and pesticides maker. The cash call is smaller than initially envisaged by Bayer because Monsanto reduced its debt while the antitrust review dragged on. Also, Bayer raised €4.5bn more from selling down its stake in plastics maker Covestro than initially expected. The German drug maker also grossed €7.6bn in proceeds from selling assets to BASF, as the antitrust reviews were stricter than anticipated, but that did not cut the need to raise money via a share issue because future cash flows to service debts would also be lower. When the merger was agreed in September 2016, Bayer said it would raise $19bn worth of fresh equity capital for the takeover deal, parts of which was covered by issuing €4bn in mandatory convertible notes in November 2016. Bayer has said it would close the transaction very soon, which it needs to do because Monsanto could withdraw from the takeover agreement and seek a higher price after 14 June. Bayer is set to close the transaction on 7 June, according to a media report yesterday. Bayer will create an agricultural supplies giant with sales of about €20bn, based on 2017 figures, when taking into account the divestments. At current foreign exchange rates, that compares to about €12.4bn at DOWDUPONT's Corteva Agriscience unit, €11bn at ChemChina's Syngenta and €7.9bn at BASF, including businesses to be acquired. The Bayer-Monsanto tie-up has kept being pushed back. Last September Bayer told shareholders it expected to complete the transaction in ""early 2018"", and previously it had guided that it would tie up the deal by the end of 2017."
4-Jun-18,City AM,Smurfit readies for last-ditch bid from US rival,"THIS week could be a momentous one for cardboard packaging company Smurfit Kappa, which is currently the target of one of the biggest live takeover bids in the FTSE 100. The business, which tore up an €8.9bn (£7.8bn) takeover bid in March from US packaging firm International Paper (IP), could have to fend off one last takeover attempt as the deadline for its suitor to make a final bid approaches. Memphis-based IP, whose advances have so far been rejected by Smurfit's boss Anthony Smurfit as ""fundamentally undervaluing"" the business, has until Wednesday to either lay a final bid on the table or be banned from approaching the company for another year. However, City sources have speculated that a rival bid could be in the pipeline, as City A.M. understands that FTSE 100-listed Mondi has also appointed bankers to explore further deals. Smurfit has been urged by a number of its investors, including asset manager Janus Henderson, to hold talks with IP, but has so far refused. ""The board is resolute in its belief that the best interests of the group's stakeholders are served by pursuing its future as an independent company,"" said the business, which operates in 35 countries. Janus Henderson has indicated that it would not support an offer below €40 per share. IP's last increased offer was of €25.25 in cash and 0.3 IP shares, which gave a combined total of around €37 per share. However, some analysts have warned that IP should be wary of scaling up its offer too much, since it might not be able to make the necessary savings from the deal. ""One of the primary concerns investors have had since the news about IP's initial approach broke was that the synergy opportunities weren't obvious given the lack of geographic overlap,"" said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Adam Josephson. Smurfit's shares climbed almost 27 per cent on news of the original bid. The Irish company also completed its own €460m deal last month in an attempt to detract from the siege. It announced it had agreed to acquire Reparenco, a paper business in the Netherlands which owns a 675,000 tonne capacity mill. Online shopping has helped to boost demand for packaging businesses such as Smurfit, and those such as USheadquartered IP have been looking to wangle a larger foothold in the booming European market."
4-Jun-18,City AM,Sorrell will find it harder to grow his second empire,"THE NEWS that Martin Sorrell has re-entered the ad industry via the takeover of a littleknown shell company, Derriston Capital (set to be renamed S4 Capital), naturally has echoes of his acquisition of a wire, paper, and plastics firm in 1985. Of course, that firm is now WPP, one of the world's largest ad agencies, from which Sorrell was ousted as chief executive just over seven weeks ago. The most interesting challenge that Sorrell now faces is building a next-generation marketing group without doing too much (further) damage to WPP, where he still remains a significant shareholder. To start with, he will need a clear platform acquisition, either in the UK or US, which provides access to a range of capabilities, growth, and a level of cash flow. However, the circumstances of that acquisition differ greatly from his initial acquisitions back in the early days of WPP, where he notably acquired JWT - a business 13 times the size of his own. In fact, within its first two years, WPP made 16 acquisitions - something that he is unlikely to be able to repeat in 2018. First, tech and digital businesses enjoy notoriously high valuations, so it's going to be financially more challenging. Second, the market is far more competitive. The likes of Facebook, Google, and even the consultancies are threats Sorrell didn't have to consider back in 1985, and they will ensure it's critical for him, personally as much as anything, to get the first acquisition right. Through his own personal brand and extensive network, he is not likely to find it difficult to identify potential acquisition targets. However, the combination of relatively limited amounts of money being available to his new firm, his likely desire to bring together more than one discipline, and a far more competitive market will mean potential targets that meet the criteria will be fewer and further between than might initially be expected. So what will he be looking for? As well as the access to data, analytics, and content that he has referenced, strategic, channel planning, and performance marketing capabilities will also be key. Widespread disruption within all sectors, from entertainment to retail, means the ability to deliver agile, multidisciplinary (but digitally-centric) marketing solutions is being readily demanded by brands, small or large. Any acquisition will need to demonstrate that offering. With this in mind, the greatest chance that S4 has is if Sorrell can build something smaller and more perfectly formed than WPP, which found that its size had started to work against itself, with silos and organisational barriers (such as incentive schemes) getting in the way of collaboration. While the early acquisition strategy of WPP was right - to blend marketing services under one roof providing an easy one-stop-shop for brands - it increasingly lacked agility, and instead offered a service that began to reflect its structures, rather than the needs of its clients. And today, clients are no longer looking for a one-stop-shop solution, but rather a flexible team designed around their specific needs. This team must provide high-quality strategy and creative frameworks that can be consistently executed across channels, while leveraging data and technical innovations where appropriate. Thus, I would expect a much more entrepreneurial model to emerge from S4 that focuses on putting multi-disciplinary solutions together at an agency or country level - rather than holding company - therefore ensuring that they are designed around current client demands, not legacy agency structures. £ Peter Reid is chief executive of MSQ Partners."
31-May-18,City AM,Phoenix starts £950m issue for insurance deal,"SPECIALIST insurer Phoenix announced a £950m rights issue yesterday which is intended to fund its £3.2bn purchase of Standard Life Aberdeen's insurance arm. Phoenix will pay Standard Life Aberdeen £1.97bn upon completion of the deal to acquireStandard Life Assurance Limited (SLAL), which excludes a dividend of £312m paid by SLAL to Standard Life Aberdeen prior to completion. Standard Life Aberdeen will take a nearly 20 per cent stake in the enlarged group. The rights issue, which will help fund the deal, will result in the issue of 183,522,385 new shares, representing approximately 46.7 per cent of the existing share capital of Phoenix. The rights issue will be on the basis of seven new shares at 518p per new share for every 15 existing shares. The underwriters for the deal are banks HSBC, Merrill Lynch International, JP Morgan Securities and BNP Paribas. On Tuesday Standard Life Aberdeen revealed plans to return £1.75bn to its shareholders following the sale of SLAL to Phoenix. However, the plan failed to impress investors with its share price falling 2.5 per cent on Tuesday following the announcement. Standard Life's shares closed flat on the news yesterday. Under the terms of the deal Standard Life Aberdeen and Phoenix will continue to collaborate with Aberdeen Standard Investments continuing as Phoenix's main asset management partner. Phoenix has also granted Aberdeen a first right of refusal for investment management mandates on new assets. Standard Life Aberdeen's shareholders will vote on the deal next month."

However in January this year it purchased Harrods Bank, and acquired a full banking licence in the process. As a result of the purchase, Tandem also gained Harrods Bank's 11,000 customer accounts, as well as £80m of capital, and over £350m in deposits. The bank currently offers one 0.5 per cent cashback credit card product and a fixed saver account, with an instant access product planned for release later this year. Across its three fixed saver tiers, Tandem has said it currently holds more than £10m in deposits from its users. It also recently acquired money management startup Pariti, which helps users get a view of their finances by aggregating their bank accounts into one app. Tandem boss Ricky Knox said: ""There is a lot of noise surrounding the legacy banks moving into the digital only challenger market, which is great. However, we are moving at twice the pace and as a small agile organisation we are accelerating as we speak."""
30-May-18,City AM,Brand new: How to grow your business post-merger,"Up to 90 per cent of M&A deals end in failure - so here're some tips for Sainsbury's and Asda LET'S face it, apart from shareholders, no one is keen on a merger. Customers often fear choice reduction, staff fear job losses, and in the case of Sainsbury's and Asda, the supply chain fears increased price pressure. So what makes a successful merger? It's a timely question given that M&A activity is at an all-time high, partly driven by the weakened pound and low valuations for UK businesses. Both Asda and Sainsbury's have bold, fully-established brands where customers know what to expect when they walk into a store. That means these two supermarket giants have a different set of challenges to most brands post-merger, where a new brand is created (Dixons Retail + Carphone Warehouse = Dixons Carphone), or one swallows the other whole and the parent brand needs redefining (Morrisons + Safeway = Morrisons). With this in mind, I'd advise any merger and integration team to consider the following. MEETING OF MINDS While many mergers are about market dominance, the best are a deeper meeting of minds. Think Microsoft and LinkedIn, or Disney and 21st Century Fox. Establishing common themes, cultures, and styles of leadership will help you set the foundations to build a common philosophy and customer proposition. It's a chance to become more than the sum of your parts from the outset. THE FUTURE IS NOW It's important for businesses to fight the urge to focus on short-term to-do lists, and instead to be radical. Ask ""how big is our future?"" and work backwards from there. That's the way Amazon's been thinking, with diverse acquisitions from grocery chain Whole Foods to video streaming platform Twitch. NO NAVEL-GAZING Many big mergers get called off lastminute (remember Kraft Heinz and Unilever last year?), leaving both businesses suddenly behind their competition. This is often due to eyes on both sides focusing on internal ambitions and impending operational realities. What's missing is external perspective. Keep an eye on global trends, and cultivate curiosity. UNITE THE CLANS A new venture needs a narrative that works as a rallying cry for its new, combined workforce - even when the brands remain standalone. For Sainsbury's and Asda, this should be relatively simple from a slogan perspective. Asda's ""Save Money. Live Better"" slogan speaks well to Sainsbury's ""Live Well For Less"", providing a cohesive narrative for the two to drive towards a united future. NEW LOOK? Not every merger needs a radical brand overhaul, but as a business hones its story, assess whether it best represents what it wants to tell customers. A merger is an opportunity to present a fresh identity to the world. Ultimately, every merger is unique, and they represent a major turning point for businesses. I'll be interested to see how this latest deal fares, both as a shopper in my local Sainsbury's, and as a curious brand expert."
24-May-18,City AM,Barclays-StanChart plan rubbished by City analysts,"THE CITY yesterday rubbished suggestions that Barclays could merge with Asian-focused bank Standard Chartered, with analysts dubbing the idea ""far-fetched"", saying shareholders would be ""horrified"". Barclays' chairman John McFarlane has been tentatively exploring the move - which could create a £60bn sprawling giant - as the bank looks to fend off activist investor Ed Bramson, who is seeking to scrap its investment arm. The merger would be at odds with chief executive Jes Staley's strategy of focusing on the UK high street and pits the two executives against each other: according to a Financial Times report, McFarlane is keen to bring StanChart boss Bill Winters in as chief executive of the combined group. But City analysts poured scorn on the entire idea. ""If I discovered that they are in advanced discussions or anything of that nature I would fall off my chair,"" Investec analyst Ian Gordon told City A.M. ""Put simply, the numbers just don't add up."" The whole notion was ""farfetched"" and Barclays shareholders would be ""horrified"" if cash were used on M&A instead of Staley's muted share buybacks. Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets, agreed the plan was unlikely. ""It sounds like dinner table talk - two chief executives chewing the fat over a beer and a steak. ""I can see the synergies but in terms of capital requirements it's a tall order, both banks are in the middle of restructuring programmes. There is not much in way of overlap but the extra capital they would have to raise makes any prospective deal difficult."" Artjom Hatsaturjants, research analyst at Accendo Markets, said investors should treat it ""sceptically"". ""As far as the rationale it makes sense to fend off some of the activist investor pressure, but whether this is the correct approach it is hard to say."" A Barclays spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on speculation."" A spokesperson for Standard Chartered said: ""We are entirely focused on executing our strategy, and do not comment on this type of speculation."""
22-May-18,City AM,Donald clinches £40m takeover of Sunderland,"INSURANCE tycoon and former owner of non-league Eastleigh Stewart Donald has taken control of Sunderland after effectively completing a £40m buyout of American businessman Ellis Short. Donald said the club, which has been relegated from the Premier League to English football's third tier in successive seasons, was now free of debt after previous owner Ellis Short agreed to write off more than £100m. The deal, first announced last month, is due to completed this week following ratification from the English Football League. ""We've given Ellis £40m, so that's the deal, and in return Ellis has tidied up his debt and that has now gone from the football club,"" said multi-millionaire Donald, 47. ""Ellis was very clear he didn't want the debt, but we didn't want the debt either so we refused that. The reality is Sunderland is debt-free which for the fans is good news."" Donald invested more than £7m into Eastleigh over six years, helping them rise to the fifth tier and redeveloping their stadium, but has given up ownership of the Hampshire outfit as a condition of his Sunderland takeover. The owner of Oxfordshire-based brokers Bridle Insurance had initially been set to lead an international consortium of investors in buying out Texan Short but has instead taken over personally, citing a desire to avoid delays that could affect the club's summer business. He was speaking at Monday's media conference alongside public relations guru Charlie Methven, who is expected to be named on the new board. Donald said he hoped to appoint a new manager within seven days, following the departure of former Wales boss Chris Coleman in April, and promised transfer funds to revive the ailing club's fortunes. ""The budget for Sunderland is going to be pretty hefty, and much more than of the teams that were promoted last season,"" he added."
21-May-18,City AM,There's more to come in the M&A pipeline,"Equity markets nearing all-time record highs, interest rates still low and a weak pound have created a cauldron for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that analysts anticipate continuing while current market conditions persist. Two FTSE 100 companies have already been acquired this year, a third looks set to go and with two more facing bids, 2018 is already one of the busiest years for FTSE M&A in recent times. City A.M. asked analysts if they thought the M&A maelstrom would continue, which companies could be targeted next and if the current frantic dealmaking signalled a market that was nearing its peak. ""A possible bidding war for serviced offices provider IWG would be merely the latest takeover drama that has enlivened the UK stock market in 2018 - and in the process enriched investors, who could now be forgiven for trying to identify the next potential targets for a predator, especially as the latest decline in the pound means British assets are cheaper for overseas buyers,"" says Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director. FTSE constituents GKN and Ladbrokes have both been acquired already this year by UK firms Melrose and GVC respectively. Sky finally received an approach from US-based Comcast, Smurfit Kappa is being bid on by New York-listed International Paper and the long pursuit of Shire by Japanese rival Takeda looks close to concluding. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, argues another driving factor behind the hot market could be chief executives looking to close deals while money is still cheap. ""We are late in the cycle, so that tends to mean you get M&A. Combined with that, interest rates are climbing, the era of cheap money is coming to an end and if you are funding M&A activity via debt you are drinking in the last-chance saloon,"" he says. David Madden of CMC Markets agrees, adding: ""The cost of borrowing is going up and if you are funding [M&A] through borrowing you will want to get your skates on."" Mould argues that five further companies are ripe for a takeover approach: broadcaster ITV, challenger bank One-SavingsBank, energy company SSE, telecoms business TalkTalk and bookmaker William Hill. ITV, a perennial subject of takeover speculation, saw its share rise more than seven per cent on Friday after brokers tipped it as a potential target. Ken Odelunga, a market analyst at City Index, says: ""Logically you think it's the last one on the shelf - it has had some issues and it doesn't appear to have any channel towards newer forms of broadcast."" The challenger banking sector, which has failed to shake-up the banking market in the way that some predicted, is also one that analysts say could see further dealmaking. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group has launched a £1.6bn bid for Virgin Money and Aldermore agreed a deal with First Rand in November. Madden says: ""It is tough for those guys, the regulatory demands for some of them are a little bit too onerous and there is switching inertia."" In the energy sphere, Mould argues that SSE may be a target if the proposed merger of its retail energy supply business with Npower's goes ahead. He also cites Talktalk as of possible interest in the hyper-competitive telecoms sector. Meanwhile William Hill's new chairman Roger Devlin said proposed legislation to cut the maximum stake for fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) to £2 could leave the company vulnerable to a foreign takeover bid, according to reports last week. However, a US Supreme Court ruling on Monday that struck down legislation that restricted betting on sport sent bookmakers shares soaring, changing the likelihood of a successful approach."
17-May-18,City AM,Tharisa acquires 90pc shareholding in Salene as it moves into Zimbabwe,"CHROME miner Tharisa has gained access to rich chrome deposits after acquiring a 90 per cent shareholding in Salene Chrome Zimbabwe, making it the company's first step into the country, it said yesterday. Cyprus-based Tharisa will now have access to the Great Dyke mineral belt, of which Salene has area covering approximately 95 square kilometres. It acquired the stake from Leto Settlement Trust, which retained 10 per cent of the shareholding in Salene and will receive a three per cent royalty on all chrome sales. The Great Dyke deposit in Zimbabwe is the world's largest known source of platinum group metals and chrome, according to the company's statement. Up until now, the company has had its main operation in South Africa with its Tharisa Mine located in the Bushveld complex. Although the company's earnings have been affected by decreasing chrome prices and a higher rand, it announced that it would give a two cents maiden dividend. Tharisa announced in its financial results for the six months ending 31 March that its net profit fell by 44 per cent to $28.4m (£21m) but that both its chrome production and revenue had risen."
16-May-18,City AM,Lonmin mining merger awaits antitrust review,"THE COMPETITION and Markets Authority (CMA) said it will review the takeover by South African company Sibanye-Stillwater of platinum miner Lonmin to determine whether it would harm market competition. The £285m takeover would make it the second largest platinum producer in the world, second only to Anglo American Platinum. The deal, which is set to close later this year, has not yet been approved by either company's shareholders and depends on approval from both the CMA and the South African market competition authority. Lonmin, which has suffered a substantial financial decline recently, said on Monday it plans to cut annual spending. This will lead to 1,500 redundancies within the company and could potentially put another 12,600 jobs at risk over the next three years. Sibanye-Stillwater said that if Lonmin did not stabilise its finances by the time the deal is set to close, it would not go ahead with it. Yesterday, Lonmin's share price fell by four per cent and Sibanye-Stillwater's by more than five per cent on news of the antitrust probe. Sibanye-Stillwater made an allshare offer in December of last year offering 0.967 new shares in the company for every Lonmin share. Shore Capital analyst Yuen Low told City A.M. he thought the merger would decrease competition significantly as both Lonmin and Sibanye-Stillwater are each responsible for a large bulk of the world's platinum production. However, he added: ""I am leaning towards approvals from the South African and UK competition authorities, because Lonmin going bust would be even worse for competition. This is not to say that the CMA approval process will necessarily prove straightforward."" ""The CMA might decide to investigate in more depth and/or kick an unfavourable finding 'upstairs' to the relevant secretary of state for a final decision. ""For its part, Lonmin will clearly be hoping for 'straightforward' transaction clearance on 10 July,"" he continued."
15-May-18,City AM,Platinum miner cutting spending as takeover nears,"PLATINUM mining giant Lonmin yesterday announced it will cut spending and job roles after net cash fell 77 per cent, but said it still set to be bought by Sibanye-Stillwater. The company's net cash decreased from $75m (£55m) last March to only $17m in the six months to 31 March, it said in results out yesterday. While the total tonnes of platinum mined was only marginally down from last year, with a 1.1 per cent decrease, the company was particularly affected by lower platinum prices. As a result of the loss, Lonmin said it will cut its annual spending target, which will include letting go of 1,504 company employees. The company's share price rose 7.44 per cent by the close, to 52.15p. Lonmin, which is the world's third largest producer of platinum, said because of the difficult operating environment caused by the low platinum prices, it may have to continue to cut spending. It added that this could affect 12,600 jobs over the next three years on top of the redundancies it has already had to make. Sibanye-Stillwater, the company seeking to take over Lonmin, has said that it will walk away from the deal if it turns out that Lonmin does not have the net cash required when the deal is set to close later this year. Nevertheless, Lonmin has said that the takeover is set to continue as planned. The offer made by Sibanye-Stillwater of a £285m takeover is yet to be approved by both companies' shareholders and is still awaiting approval from both the UK and South African competition authorities before Lonmin can go ahead with the takeover. Chief executive of Lonmin, Ben Magara, said: ""The Lonmin team remains focused on operational excellence, and dealing successfully with tougher conditions that currently face our entire industry. ""As is typical of transactions of this nature [Sibanye-Stillwater deal], our focus remains on minimising disruption to the business as we move towards completion. We have to remain cash vigilant in order to maintain a resilient business, ready for the next era."""
15-May-18,City AM,IWG share price leaps 20pc after takeover talks,"SHARES in serviced office firm International Workplace Group (IWG) jumped more than 22 per cent yesterday after it was revealed that the company was in talks for a full-share takeover. The company confirmed on Friday that it had interest from three separate private equity firms: Lone Star, Starwood Capital and TDR Capital over the potential sale. ""The board is evaluating the possible offers with its financial advisers and shareholders will be updated in due course,"" the statement explained. A FTSE 250-listed company, IWG is valued at around £2.1bn and posted profits of £149.4m last year. However, a profit warning last year led to a takeover attempt from Canadian property group Brookfield, though the £2.4bn bid was eventually rejected. Lone Star, Starwood and TDR will now have until 8 June to announce a firm offer or drop their bid for a takeover. The company has faced increased competition from flexible office space companies like WeWork and UK startup The Office Group. Announcing its first-quarter results earlier this month, the company said that it would ""continue to invest in our national networks to maintain our clear industry leadership""."
9-May-18,City AM,Watchdog turns up the heat on Npower-SSE deal,"THE UK'S competition authority has said it will launch a full investigation into the proposed merger of energy firms Npower and SSE, after they failed to address concerns about the impact on competition and prices for consumers. The firms announced a deal in November in which Britain's second-largest supplier, SSE, would merge and spin off its household energy and supply business to create an independent supplier with Innogy's Npower. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal ""warrants further scrutiny"". Yesterday the watchdog said neither firm had been able to offer measures to address its concerns, and so it has referred the merger for a more in-depth investigation. A decision on the merger will now be made by a group of independent panel members supported by CMA staff. The deadline for the final report is 22 October. The energy market has already been in the spotlight over a lack of competition following an in-depth report by the CMA which said customers were paying £1.4bn more than they would in a fully competitive market. The government is poised to introduce a price cap on default energy tariffs as early as Christmas in a bid to tackle what it calls a ""broken"" market."
9-May-18,City AM,The future of UK supermarkets is big data and personalisation,"THE PROPOSED merger of two supermarket giants, Asda and Sainsbury's, has been hailed as one of the new ""forces of UK retail"". But in a rush to point out that the combined chain would have nearly a third of the UK supermarket sector, one key factor has been ignored: Amazon. Amazon recently launched its online grocery delivery service. Known for its speed, convenience and ease of use, we expect many shoppers to flock to the ecommerce behemoth as commonplace for their weekly shop in the near future. And who knows, maybe it won't be long before Facebook and Google move into the supermarket space. When heading to a competitor's website is as easy as an app download away, traditional supermarkets need to innovate to retain their competitive edge. The question for Sainsbury's and Asda is how do two very different brands still keep the customer at the heart of the shopping experience, and compete with ecommerce giants that have personalisation and big data use literally coded into their business models? Out of the UK chains, Sainsbury's has led the way in adopting and embracing a highly consumer-centric approach, while Asda's strategy has focused on driving costs down and passing the price benefit to the customer. Will we now see a cross-pollination of ideas resulting in a superior customer experience at an unbeatable value, or will the new venture react to the threat by the budget chains Aldi and Lidl to become a highly cost-focused organisation? While it might be tempting to go for the latter and slash costs, the former is where the true value lies. Retaining a competitive edge today is all about understanding customer triggers, using insights and big data. Gaining a deeper understanding of customer demands, and mining data across the wave of digital channels, is imperative to delivering a personalised experience. Amazon has spent decades perfecting this, and has a substantial headstart on the big retails chains. This isn't just about pouring resources into websites. Physical stores will continue to drive forward a significant portion of supermarket revenue, and delivering a customised experience cannot be overlooked here either. Earlier this year, the opening of Amazon's first physical store demonstrated how retailers can disrupt the traditional bricks and mortar approach, enhancing rather than replacing them. In the Amazon store, smart cameras and sensors observed what customers put in their baskets and charged them directly on their accounts, with no need for checkouts. This may seem like a gimmick, but making innovative use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), is crucial for the retail sector. If supermarkets want to keep up with the competition, this must be a cornerstone of their approach, in order to minimise supply chain costs, and make more insightful decisions for the benefit of their customers. AI is not something to be feared. It may lead to job replacement, but in retail it can be a real force for good in decision making and the customer journey mapping process. AI technology, combined with smart sensors and the IoT, will also play an integral role in automating the supply chain, improving store efficiencies, and reducing operating costs. It is partly down to this technology that Amazon is able to provide such a personalised service, while keeping costs so low. The merger of Asda and Sainsbury's spells big news for the retail sector, but we should not become fixated on whether having one fewer supermarket brand means less consumer choice. Rather, this is about the opportunity to offer customers a more personalised experience. If the combined chain can put consumer needs first, harness technology, and focus on designing the right store experience, the merger will be a force to reckon with against the online challenger brands. The future for UK supermarkets is bright - but the opportunities need to be grasped with open arms, now. Simply merging isn't enough. £ Anil Gandharve is head of retail, CPG and Manufacturing at Mindtree. Amazon has spent decades perfecting this, and has a substantial headstart"
3-May-18,City AM,Sainsbury's Asda deal - in the money or in jeopardy?,"CITY TALK PARTNER CONTENT Matthew West discusses the possible effects between the merger between superstores Sainsbury's and Asda INFINOX TALK In the pantheon of ""I didn't realise that microphone was on"" gaffes, it was up near Gordon Brown's disastrous - some say election-losing - shocker in 2010. This week the chief executive of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, was caught on tape singing ""We're in the Money"" in between a round of media interviews that had been called for him to announce the retail giant's plans to merge with its rival Asda. On the face of it, Mr Coupe had good reason to be cheerfully singing away. He is in the money. As a major shareholder in Sainsbury's, he saw the value of his shareholding in the firm he runs leap just over 20 per cent on Monday compared with Friday's closing price. UK markets clearly warmed to news of the takeover. In the US however, Asda's parent company, Wal-Mart, saw its share price rise by a far more modest 2 per cent in the first half hour of trading on Wall Street on Monday. Evidence perhaps that Asda means somewhat less across the Atlantic than it does here in Britain, particularly given Wal-Mart will retain a very significant 43 per cent shareholding in Asda. GOOD DEAL FOR WAL-MART We were told on Monday that the £10bn merger would create a combined group worth £5.9bn, making it bigger than Tesco - the current market leader - with a 31 per cent market share. Mr Coupe would become group chief executive (CEO) but Asda would retain its CEO and continue to be run from Leeds. Staff and customers alike were assured there would be no store closures and no job cuts, and that prices in both Asda and Sainsbury stores would come down by 10 per cent on average. So what's not to like? Well, for Wal-Mart nothing, Asda is a good business to get rid of. It's been a bit of an albatross around the US giant's neck in recent years. That's in part as a result of the need to squeeze margins thanks to what are disparagingly described as the discount grocers Aldi and Lidl. Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrison have all also been under huge pressure in recent years for the same reason. And let's not forget that Sainsbury's bought home retailer Argos two years ago for £1.4bn, in part as a way of combating the threat from Amazon, which has begun to make inroads into the grocery business. ATTACK IS THE BEST FORM OF DEFENCE Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are usually illustrative of one of two things. More often than not they are a signal that a market sector is consolidating in order for some companies to grow and to pull in expertise. Those businesses with pots of cash buy up smaller rivals because they like their business and the rival perhaps does something a bit better than they themselves do, so will add value to their company. But M&A activity can also be a sign of weakness and self-defence. Is that what is happening here? There's no doubt that together Asda and Sainsbury's can cut costs, even if that doesn't mean staff or stores. The combined group's market share will enable it to tighten the screws on suppliers and drive down their prices - which seems inevitable, regardless of Mr Coupe's assurances to the contrary. To what extent such savings will be passed on to the consumer is another matter too. These were among the points made by Charles Newsome, division director at Investec Wealth and Investment on Monday and it is probably a view shared by other market analysts. Moreover, it is hard to believe there will be no job losses or store closures, particularly if you consider that in many towns Sainsbury's and Asda stores are but a stone's throw from one another and retail space is awfully expensive these days. Then there is the issue of competition. The way the deal is structured, Sainsbury's will probably get it past the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and consolidation in the grocery market is nothing new either. But in essence Britain will be left with just three big supermarkets - one of which was looking decidedly wobbly a year or two ago - regardless of the brands that may still exist. That's almost certainly an undesirable state of affairs.

3-May-18,City AM,Megadeals help UK buck falling M&A in Europe,"UK COMPANIES received more investment through announced mergers and acquisitions (M&A) than any of their western European peers in April, and are set to rake in €58.4bn (£42.8bn) - the largest monthly value for the country since July 2016. Comcast's eventual £22bn formal bid for Sky topped the deal rankings, while Sainsbury's offer to buy Asda for £7.3bn closed the month in a strong second place, according to research from Moody's analytics company Bureau van Dijk. Yet the number of deals announced across western Europe fell to a low not seen in more than a year, and private equity and venture capital (PE and VC) interest in the region also decreased. Though the UK is often Europe's largest private equity market, it only saw western Europe's fifth largest private equity-backed deal in April as Goldman Sachs and Antin Infrastructure took on Cityfibre. ""Despite the disappointing result in terms of deal values across both M&A and PE and VC deals over the fourweek period, there have been a number of sizeable deals announced during April with all of the top 20 M&A deals by value exceeding €1bn,"" said Bureau van Dijk director Lisa Wright. ""This shows there is a substantial appetite for deal making in western Europe as we move into the second quarter."" While the UK led western Europe in terms of overall announced M&A value, Germany led by volume of deals. Its businesses featured in 425 deals, ahead of the UK's 379, while both Germany and Spain managed to get into the double figures in terms of deal value with €24.6bn and €15bn respectively. Although private equity interest in western Europe appeared to take a breather in April, data released yesterday from trade body Invest Europe showed last year was strong. Private equity investment in European companies hit a 10-year high of €71.7bn in 2017, a 29 per cent increase year-on-year, while almost 7,000 companies received funding. France and Benelux-based companies received 27 per cent of private equity investments in 2017, closely followed by the UK & Ireland with 26 per cent. Funds raised by European private equity houses hit €91.9bn, the highest amount since 2008 and surpassing the previous year by 12 per cent."

FIM had £893m in assets under management, bringing Gresham's total to more than £1.5bn. Gresham House, which will continue to focus on forestry, new energy, UK housing and infrastructure, private assets and strategic public equity, will initially pay £21m for the business. This will include £11.2m of cash and £9.8m of loan notes to be converted into Gresham House shares. A further £4m will be paid if performance conditions are met by two years after the deal. Gresham's chief executive Anthony Dalwood said the deal would help it become a leader in UK commercial forestry. The deal is Gresham's third in as many years, and helped the firm's share price rise by almost three per cent yesterday. Gresham, which is listed on London's junior Alternative Investment Market, also announced it would raise up to £15m to help finance the deal by placing new shares. Any leftover cash could be used for more acquisitions, the company said. The firm's current shareholders include names such as the Berkshire Pension Fund, Majedie, River & Mercantile, Saffie Investments (the family office of private equity veteran Damon Buffini), Charles Stanley and the Alliance Trust."
2-May-18,City AM,T-Mobile's win lifts telco deals to 12-year high,"THE VALUE of global telco mergers and acquisition activity hit its highest in 12 years thanks to T-Mobile's mammoth $59bn (£43bn) bid for Sprint. News of the deal was announced on Sunday, marking the end of four years of back-and-forth between the two companies. The new enterprise will most likely be called T-Mobile and be run under the company's chief executive John Legere. Data released yesterday by Thomson Reuters showed that the deal was big enough to push global telco mergers and acquisitions up to a value of $107.6bn from 223 transactions during 2018. It also revealed that the T-Mobile Sprint deal is the eighth largest telecom transaction on record, and the biggest since Verizon's $130.3bn acquisition of Verizon Wireless in 2013, the second biggest telco deal of all time. The biggest deal of all time remains Vodafone Air Touch's friendly merger with Mannesmann in 1999, where the British telco purchased the firm for around £202.8bn (adjusted for today's currency rates). Guy Peddy, telecoms analyst at Macquarie Group said: ""Clearly, operators are looking for scale ahead of the 5G roll out so mergers and acquisitions are an inevitable way to increase their networks and reach."" But Peddy reckoned the figures would probably not be beaten in 2019. ""The deal between Sprint and T-Mobile US is one of the biggest possible intra-sector deals we've seen so these figures inflate the overall stats looking into 2019,"" he added. The new company formed by the TMobile deal will be worth a combined total of $146bn, enabling the firm to branch into the emerging 5G market. Last year, a report by law firm Baker McKenzie and consultants Oxford Economics estimated that total global mergers and acquisition activity would reach $3.2 trillion in 2018, as dealmaking lifts on an economic tide. In February, research based around lawyers' preparations predicted mergers and acquisitions would grow 10 per cent in the first half of 2018."
2-May-18,City AM,How would a potential merger affect Asda and Sainsbury's?,"EARLIER this week grocery giants Asda and Sainsbury's sent shockwaves through the retail industry as they announced merger plans. If the proposal is successful, the new organisation could overtake Tesco as the UK's largest retailer. There are some obstacles to clear before the merger is confirmed of course. The Competition and Markets Authority will have to review the deal and there are also questions about how the move would work in practical terms. But from a consumer perspective, YouGov BrandIndex shows that there is already some crossover of current customers of both supermarkets. Of those who have shopped at Asda within the past month, 37 per cent say they have also shopped at Sainsbury's in that time. Among the general public, Sainsbury's already has relatively strong brand health. Its most recent quality score sits at 44 and purchase consideration at 43. However, its value score is far lower at nine - less than half of Asda's score (23). Looking at a long-term analysis of the brands, the data shows that, as Sainsbury's has seen a gradual decline across several metrics over the past three years, Asda has seen an increase in some. While Sainsbury's has built its reputation on its quality offering to middleclass shoppers, Asda has been known for everyday low prices. While that remains the case, both have come under pressure from discounters Aldi and Lidl, two brands that have surpassed expectations and gained increased market share. Our data indicates that it is not just those on lower incomes that have been drawn to the German stores. Among those who say they earn at least £50,000 a year, Aldi's purchase consideration score (whether someone would consider buying from the brand) has climbed from 26 to 37 over the past two years. Despite Sainsbury's shoppers looking for quality, YouGov Profiles data reinforces the need for a good value offering, with 71 per cent of those who shop in Sainsbury's and 78 per cent of those who choose Asda saying they are usually looking for the lowest prices when they go shopping. While the merger will need work in terms of the overall brand architecture, there is great potential for the move to work if customers benefit from both companies' core offering. £ Stephan Shakespeare is the chief executive of YouGov"
27-Apr-18,City AM,New suitors wait in the wings for Norwegian Air,"NORWEGIAN Air Shuttle yesterday admitted it has received ""several inquiries"" following IAG's acquisition of 4.6 per cent of its shares, causing its board to bring in financial advisors to handle the situation. The company revealed the news while unveiling its financial results for the first quarter of this year. ""Norwegian has received several inquiries following IAG Group's announcement of its acquisition of 4.6 per cent of the shares in the company,"" it said. Net profit losses narrowed to 46.2m krone (£4.17m) this year, from 1.4bn krone the previous quarter. The reduction in losses was helped by the fact Norwaybased bank Norwegian Finans Holding injecting 1.9bn krone into the airline, but losses before interest and taxes amounted to 2.2bn krone. Its revenue grew to 7bn krone. The airline increased its passenger numbers by 12 per cent to 7.5m in the first quarter, translating to capacity growth of 36 per cent and a load factor of 84.5 per cent. IAG confirmed earlier this month that it was mulling a full offer for low-cost carrier Norwegian, after picking up 4.6 per cent stake in the airline."
25-Apr-18,City AM,Takeda-Shire deal could be confirmed today,"deal that could be announced as early as today. Takeda made a fresh approach for the London-listed business yesterday, sending shares up by six per cent, with investors expecting Takeda's fifth approach to be sweeter than the £44bn cash and shares offer tabled with Shire's board on 20 April. Shire is expected to agree to an extension of today's regulatory deadline which requires Takeda to make a firm approach to shareholders by 5pm. The breathing space will allow Takeda to carry out more due diligence and solidify its offer. Takeda and Shire did not immediately respond to requests for comment last night. The Irish-headquartered firm announced the latest approach unilaterally yesterday before Takeda confirmed it later in the day. Last week, Botox maker Allergan attempted to gatecrash Takeda's pursuit of Shire with its own offer. Allergan has until 17 May to make a formal approach to shareholders. In a bizarre U-turn Allergan ruled itself out just hours after revealing an interest in the FTSE 100 firm. Shire had previously rejected Takeda's approaches in what would be the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company. At the firm's annual general meeting yesterday Shire chair Susan Kilsby said: ""Discussions between the advisers of Shire and Takeda are ongoing."""
25-Apr-18,City AM,PSA's revenue soars after Opel acquisition,"REVENUE at Peugeot and Citroen owner PSA grew by 42 per cent in the first quarter, largely thanks to last year's acquisition of Opel Vauxhall. Sales were up more than 44 per cent, including Opel Vauxhall, with PSA selling over 1m vehicles. Revenue was pushed up to €18.2bn (£16bn) from €12.7m the previous quarter. At a constant 2015 exchange rate, group revenue for 2018 was up over 21 per cent. The Citroen division saw its revenue increase by 13.3 per cent. Opel Vauxhall's automotive division was worth €4.8bn. The figures come at an interesting time for PSA, which bought the rival European operations of Vauxhall's European parent General Motors last year in a merger valued at £1.9bn. Since then, there have been pressures to close Vauxhall's plant in Ellesmere Port, where 250 jobs were cut in 2015. PSA chairman Carlos Tavares has said the firm may hold back investment in the Ellesmere Port factory until after a Brexit trade deal is finalised. It is seeking to cut 650 jobs. Earlier this month, Vauxhall launched a consultation with its dealers around the country about plans to consolidate sites as it battles with tough conditions for the car industr y. Boosting profitability has become a key concern of car makers in the UK, with falling car sales driven by the drop in demand for diesel alongside structural changes to the way in which consumers buy cars with the rise of the internet and personal contract purchases. PSA's 'Push to Pass' plan, which excludes Opel Vauxhall, aims to deliver over 4.5 per cent automotive recurring operating margins in 2016-2018 and deliver 10 per cent group revenue growth by 2018 vs 2015. Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon, chief financial officer of Groupe PSA and member of the managing board, said ""Push to Pass strategic plan and Opel Vauxhall turnaround plan are on track to make this strong performance a solid basis for the future."""
25-Apr-18,City AM,Passive funds winning active role in takeovers,"PASSIVE funds which track an index, rather than being actively invested by a stock-picking manager, are increasingly influencing UK mergers and acquisitions (M&A), according to investment bank Jefferies. Deals such as the £8.1bn takeover of engineering giant GKN by Melrose have shown that passive funds can play a key role in deciding whether the deal goes ahead, Jefferies said. This is partly because index-tracking funds are becoming more popular, and own a higher percentage of UK public companies than ever before. But also a number of active shareholders sold out of GKN in the run-up to the takeover bid, meaning the company had a disproportionate number of passive shareholders. ""The index funds on GKN's shareholder register played a significant role in determining the outcome of the bid,"" said Jefferies analysts in the bank's M&A report. ""For example, Legal & General, a passive investor which held 2.6 per cent of GKN, is said to have voted in favour of Melrose, helping to push the bid over the minimum acceptance level."" Though passive funds may make their investment decisions by tracking an index, they do generally make an active decision in public offer situations which may not be what the company's board recommends. Due to this ever-important role which the tracker funds are playing, and their growing influence in M&A situations, Jefferies pointed out that the so-called passive funds must be able to prove they have good governance structures in place so they are making the right decisions for the companies they invest in. On top of that, Jefferies said UK companies must maintain a ""supportive shareholder register, corner-stoned by blue-chip active funds""."
25-Apr-18,City AM,CityFibre unveils £537m Goldman group takeover,"SHARES in Neil Woodford-backed UK broadband infrastructure company CityFibre rocketed by 88 per cent yesterday, as it recommended an acquisition by a consortium of infrastructure funds supported by Goldman Sachs. The deal would see CityFibre bought by Connect Infrastructure Bidco, a consortium consisting of Antin Infrastructure and West Street Infrastructure Funds, which is managed by Goldman Sachs, for £537.8m. The takeover represents a premium of 92.9 per cent to the closing price of 42p per CityFibre share on 23 April. It has already been accepted by twothirds of shareholders. Founded by Greg Mesch in 2011, the company floated in 2014, and last year announced a deal with fund manager Neil Woodford's Vodafone, aiming to roll out super fast broadband to 20 per cent of the UK population in 42 cities. The company also announced its full-year results, showing that turnover increased 126 per cent to £34.8m, while gross profits went up 48.4 per cent to £20.1m. Speaking to City A.M, Mesch said: ""Moving into a more public build setting is better for long-term acquisition, focusing on shareholders looking at 10-year plus returns and shifting into a new environment. ""We see the business market continue to grow as all companies switch to fibre, with every premise set to be fibre over the next decade."" But Macquarie Group telecoms analyst Guy Peddy warned the move could negatively affect the market. ""The risk for the UK is we expected CityFibre to be a vehicle to consolidate the smaller FTTP (fibre to the premises) builders. The disappearance of CityFibre could make this tougher to deliver in the long term."""
19-Apr-18,City AM,BT rings in the changes with division merger,"BT ANNOUNCED the latest stage in its operational overhaul yesterday, merging its public sector and wholesale arms. The telecoms giant, whose shares are languishing near a five-year low, said BT business boss Graham Sutherland would step down with wholesale head Gerry McQuade taking control of the newly combined units, which will be called BT Enterprise. The overhaul is the latest in a series of changes by BT proposed by consultants tasked with streamlining the formerly state-owned firm. Last July, mobile arm EE was merged with BT's retail arm along with cutprice subsidiary Plusnet. A broader consumer division was created and headed up by EE boss Marc Allera. BT was delivered a blow last month by credit agency Moody's, which downgraded the company. After navigating a challenging 2017 which included a £530m accounting black hole and profit warning, Moody's said BT's ""operational performance has weakened"". While shares have subsequently rebounded from lows last seen during the year of the London Olympics, City concerns persist about BT's ability to guarantee long-term dividend growth. BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said: ""Having brought together our consumer and EE businesses, this is the next step in the simplification of BT's operating model. Combining our enterprise businesses will allow us to strengthen the services and products we offer to businesses and sharpen our focus on customer service, through clear accountabilities and by introducing efficiencies."" McQuade, who has led the wholesale and ventures business since 2016, ""is the right person to drive the new organisation forward"", Patterson added."
17-Apr-18,City AM,Shire will offload cancer unit to Servier for $2bn,"IRELAND-BASED Shire revealed yesterday it will sell its oncology business to France's Servier for $2.4bn (£1.7bn) as it seeks to become a leader in rare disease treatment. The move complicates a prospective takeover by Japan's Takeda, however. Last month, Takeda was forced to reveal it was mulling a bid to buy Shire, and it specifically cited Shire's oncology unit as part of its rationale for the deal. It must make any firm offer by 25 April. ""While the oncology business has delivered high growth and profitability, we have concluded that it is not core to Shire's longer-term strategy,"" said Flemming Ornskov, Shire's chief executive. ""We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to unlock further value and sharpen our focus on rare disease leadership with selec-tive disposals of non-strategic assets."" In 2017, Shire's oncology unit made revenues of $262m, and the firm said gross assets included in the transaction are worth about $1.6bn with attributable profits of around $140m. Ornskov said the board will consider returning the proceeds of the sale back to shareholders through a buyback programme. Olivier Laureau, the group president of Servier, said the deal will enable the French company to become a key global player in oncology. ""As an essential step in the evolution of the group, this acquisition allows us to establish a direct commercial presence in the United States, the world's leading pharmaceuticals market, and to strengthen our portfolio of marketed products in the territories where Servier is already present,"" Laureau said. The deal is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2018, the two said in a statement."
17-Apr-18,City AM,Wind energy investment flew to €51bn in 2017,"LAST year, a total of €51.2bn (£44.3bn) was invested into wind energy across Europe, up nine per cent from the previous year due to a surge in project and company acquisitions. Wind power represented the largest investment opportunity in the energy sector in 2017, according to Wind Europe's latest report on financing and investment trends. The report, to be published today, examines investments in new assets, refinancing transactions, mergers and acquisition at project and corporate level, public market transactions and private equity raised across the continent. It found mergers and acquisitions drove €14.4bn in investment activity, up from just €6.8bn in 2016. Company acquisition deals doubled in value last year due to the consolidation in the industry. Deal flow in public capital markets was also up in 2017 to €7.6bn as companies made use of the low interest rate environment and liquidity in the financial markets. However, new asset financing, including all infrastructure investments in the construction of new onshore and offshore wind farms, plunged 19 per cent to €22.3bn. Wind Europe said 2017 was a record year for new capacity financing, with 11.5 gigawatts (GW) of new power potential reaching final investment decision (FID) across 200 projects in Europe. The vast majority of those were in Germany and the UK, which together accounted for half of the new FIDs announced last year. This includes the 1.4 GW Hornsea 2 offshore wind farm in the UK, which is being developed by Denmark's Orsted."
17-Apr-18,City AM,Buyers circle WPP as the media empire is open to a break-up without its founder at the helm,"Sir Martin Sorrell's exit leaves the company under pressure to sell off many of its assets, says Lucy Burton Barely 24 hours since Sir Martin Sorrell abruptly left the media empire he built from scratch and bets are on as to which of the businesses he acquired will go first. Bankers and private equity giants are set to start circling WPP's market research, public relations and health divisions as Sir Martin's exit finally leaves the world's largest advertising group open to a break-up. Senior industry figures said a split is now inevitable as WPP begins life without its 73-year-old founder, who transformed a tiny manufacturer of shopping baskets into a £20bn media group made up of 400 separate companies including Ogilvy & Mather. ""The company is no longer growing, so how do you reboot shareholder value and get investors back on side again? All you can really do is crystallise value by disposing of assets,"" said Alex DeGroote, a media analyst at Cenkos Securities. ""In terms of probability I'd say it's 100pc, the question is the timeline."" The firm's market research assets, such as London-based Kantar, are deemed as the most saleable in the short-term, with City analysts expecting a Kantar sale to raise up to £3.5bn. DeGroote said its roster of PR companies such as Buchanan and Finsbury could also be sold, but he estimates that it would only fetch up to £1bn in total, while private equity giants are likely to be eyeing up WPP's health firms such as Sudler & Hennessey. ""What everyone wants in media at the moment is data, people are absolutely obsessed. Healthcare lends itself to that,"" said DeGroote. ""PR on the other hand has less data, it's not growing, it's less of an international story. PR tends to target quite a localised market, research tends to work across borders."" Be Heard Group founder Peter Scott, who started his career at Ogilvy & Mather, said the era of mammoth holding companies running the industry is coming to its end, and Sir Martin's exit is synonymous with that. ""If you go back one step and you look at the way these holding companies have evolved, you ask yourself the question - for whose benefit did they grow? Was it for clients, staff or shareholders?"" he said. ""The growth of holding companies [such as WPP, Publicis and Omnicom] really came about from the Eighties when media buying was taken away from the agencies. They saw it as an opportunity to consolidate all their media companies into large power points. That era is now coming to an end. If you take the competing groups in [WPP] such as Grey and Ogilvy, they're all fighting each other."" That's also likely to have been the case in WPP's boardroom in recent weeks. City analysts believe there was a disagreement between Sir Martin and the rest of the board over strategy while sources told The Telegraph he left after growing ""fed up and p*****d off "" with the board's handling of an internal probe into alleged misconduct, of which WPP has refused to disclose any details. Sir Martin, who has denied wrongdoing, told staff the ad giant ""will always be my baby"" after he retired on Saturday. ""This story is a tragedy because you're deconstructing what Sorrell has constructed,"" said DeGroote. ""The company will now be run in more of a shareholder way. What I mean by that is there will potentially be some special dividends off the back of some disposals. [It will become] a smaller, leaner group with a bit more focus and a lot of M&A activity."" For the investors who have been questioning Sir Martin's advertising empire in recent months, that more nimble model is exactly what they want. WPP's shares have steadily fallen in the last year as it has struggled to grow amid drops in advertising spend, the growth of social media platforms and fresh competition from consultants such as Accenture. Its forecast of no growth for 2018 despite this year's Winter Olympics and football World Cup, which should boost sales, disappointed shareholders further. ""They've had substantial investor pressure. Whereas Martin was saying it's all very difficult [in WPP's latest results], Publicis came out and said here's a three year plan, here's a solution,"" noted one senior industry figure. ""The old story that scale and volume is everything is changing - clients no longer see that as a benefit."" But while a change in strategy is inevitable, crucial questions remain unanswered which could distract the business from moving forward. Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, is among those piling pressure onto WPP to disclose the details of the allegations Sir Martin has been accused of, with many angry that the claims are still shrouded in secrecy. Then there is the tricky issue of finding a replacement for one of the most famous businessmen in the world just as the company tries reorganise itself. Mark Read, the boss of WPP Digital and digital marketing agency Wunderman, has just been made joint chief operating officer and is seen as a likely internal candidate. But some have suggested a big external name, perhaps Jeremy Darroch at Sky or Jerry Buhlmann at Dentsu, might be favoured by the City. Or even nobody at all. ""People keep going on about successors but he's not your typical man to replace because he sits at the same table as [Donald] Trump and CEOs like Bill Gates. Who are they going to get with the same profile? Nobody,"" added DeGroote. ""[Roberto] Quarta being made executive chairman indicates there won't be a replacement, no real succession plan and nobody they've got their eye on. Quarta's background is largely in private equity, he's very well versed in restructuring."""
13-Apr-18,City AM,Playtech takes bet on Italian gaming firm,"GAMBLING software firm Playtech revealed a plan to buy Italian betting and gaming company Snaitech yesterday after it bought a 71 per cent stake for €846m (£737m). Upon completion of the stake sale, which is expected in the third quarter, Playtech will be required to make a mandatory takeover offer for all the company's remaining shares. Investors appeared to think Playtech hit the jackpot, with shares closing up 5.7 per cent. ""The acquisition of Snaitech represents the continuation of our strategy to invest in leading retail brands in fast growing, regulated markets,"" said Mor Weizer, chief executive of Playtech. Weizer added that the purchase of Snaitech will diversify group revenue and deliver exposure to the huge Italian market, which Playtech said is relatively underdeveloped online. It will also mean more of the company's revenue will come from regulated markets. ""Playtech has always been at the forefront of its industry and the acquisition offers the opportunity to create a vertically integrated B2B2C [business to business to consumer] operator in Europe's largest gambling market, delivering significant value to shareholders,"" he said. Snaitech generated revenue of €890m in 2017, and the company is also involved in racetrack management and TV services. The deal will be funded by Playtech's existing cash and new debt, and it is expected to deliver cost synergies of €10m."
13-Apr-18,City AM,Disney must bid for Sky if Fox's takeover fails,"DISNEY will be required to make a mandatory offer to Sky shareholders within 28 days of its purchase of 21st Century Fox's assets, UK authorities said yesterday. The UK Takeover Panel said Disney must offer Sky shareholders 1,075p per share if competition authorities block Fox's takeover of the 61 per cent of Sky it does not already own. The decision means Disney will have to own 100 per cent of Sky if its $52bn (£37bn) deal to buy a range of Fox's assets proceeds. Disney's takeover of Fox is expected to complete after a final decision on Fox/Sky has been reached. Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox currently owns 39 per cent of Sky. The two parties agreed a £11.7bn deal to buy the shares it does not own in December 2016. But the takeover has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny and is yet to be signed off. In the latest, and anticipated final, round of probing the Competition and Markets Authority is due to deliver its report to culture secretary Matt Hancock by the end of this month. He is expected to deliver a final verdict in mid-June. Murdoch's takeover has been complicated by the mammoth deal to sell Fox's assets (only one of which is its interest in Sky) to Disney - a deal agreed in December 2017. Meanwhile, US giant Comcast, which owns CNBC among other firms, in February made its own approach to buy Sky for £22.1bn. Comcast's approach would give Sky shareholders 1,250p a share, a significant premium to Murdoch's offer. Yesterday, UK authorities said Disney would not have to make the mandatory offer in one of two eventualities: if the Competition and Markets Authority waves through the Murdoch takeover, or if Comcast's bid is accepted by Sky shareholders. Sky said it ""noted"" yesterday's announcement and urged shareholders to take no further action. 21st Century Fox (21CF) said: ""Under the ruling, any mandatory offer by Disney would only be required after Disney's acquisition of 21CF is completed, which 21CF currently expects to occur after completion of 21CF's offer for Sky."""
12-Apr-18,City AM,Trinity Mirror's Express takeover in the slow lane,"BRITAIN'S competition regulator yesterday launched an investigation into the sale of Richard Desmond's Express newspaper stable to the owner of the Daily Mirror. Media giants Trinity Mirror and Northern & Shell agreed a £127m deal in February, ending Desmond's 18-year association with some of Britain's most popular newspaper and magazine titles. Just £48m will be handed over upfront by the Mirror owner, with a further £59m paid between 2020 and 2023.The cash payment will be raised through a new £75m loan facility. A £41m plug of the Northern & Shell's pension scheme was also agreed. Further recovery payments until 2027 totalling £29.2m have been agreed with the pension trustees. ""The Express Newspapers and our celebrity magazine titles have been a key part of the Northern & Shell portfolio for many years, and I am immensely proud of building them into one of the largest newspaper and magazine groups in the UK,"" said Desmond, chairman of Northern & Shell, at the time of the agreement. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it ""will now assess whether this deal could significantly reduce competition within the UK media sector"". A deadline of 7 June has been set for a decision with interested parties invited to submit evidence to the investigation. The CMA probe comes as the same regulator is putting the final touches on its decision on 21st Century Fox's proposed takeover of Sky. The watchdog's final report is due to be handed to culture minister Matt Hancock this month with a decision expected in June."
10-Apr-18,City AM,AppScatter set to acquire Priori in £13.5m deal,"BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS app distribution and management company AppScatter has entered a conditional sale and purchase agreement to buy up all of Priori. The firm is looking to purchase 100 per cent of the software as a service (SaaS) platform for £13.5m, split into £9.45m in cash and £4.05m worth of shares at a price of 70p per ordinary share. AppScatter floated on the London Stock Exchange in September last year for £41m, and will now look to expand its business through its acquisition of Priori. The company will now complete associated fundraising to raise cash for the acquisition and the extra working capital resources for the enlarged group. The long stop date for the acquisition and completion of the fundraising is 15 May. Philip Marcella, chief executive of AppScatter Group said: ""This is exciting news for the customers of both companies. ""Priori publishers and clients will, on completion of the acquisition, benefit from wider distribution of their mobile apps across 75 app stores and AppScatter clients will benefit from new services. ""The acquisition would mark a major step forward in our quest to become the go-to source of information in the app ecosystem."""
10-Apr-18,City AM,Rathbones and Permira eyeing Speirs & Jeffrey,"ANOTHER asset manager merger is on the cards, as Rathbones yesterday confirmed it was in talks to acquire Glaswegian firm Speirs & Jeffrey. City A.M. understands that private equity firm Permira, which owns fund manager Tilney, is also sniffing around the firm. Permira has previously helped Tilney complete a number of acquisitions, from when it formed the business through the merger of Bestinvest and Tilney to the subsequent bolt-on of Towry. Both Permira and Rathbones are valuing Speirs at around £200m, according to reports in the Telegraph. Shore Capital analyst Paul McGinnis was surprised by this price, noting it was a hefty premium to the firm's assets under management and profits. ""Any synergies would need to be at least double the current level of profitability to generate a return capable of value creation,"" he wrote in a note. Rathbones added in a statement that ""there can be no certainty that any binding offer will be made"". Speirs generated pre-tax profits of £9m in the year ending 10 May 2017, on revenues of £25.3m. Rathbones last year walked away from a £600m purchase of Smith & Williamson, after it became clear that it would be hard for the deal to create value at the offered price. The cancellation came so late in the day that Rathbones lost £5m in expenses related to the deal. Tilney had also waded into that deal, as it emerged the firm had made an all-cash offer which also fell through. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the asset and wealth management space have become increasingly common in recent years, as tightening regulation has forced firms to seek economies of scale."
9-Apr-18,City AM,Asset managers in merger with careers group,"THE TRADE body representing asset managers, the Investment Associ-ation (IA), is merging with careers provider Investment20/20 in a bid to drive diversity in the investment management industry. Both bodies will combine their expertise and resources to expand industry efforts to make investment management more accessible and attractive to people from a wide range of backgrounds. Investment20/20, which was co-founded by fund manager Nichola Pease, focuses on hiring apprentices from state schools and encouraging people from diverse backgrounds to consider a career in the finance sector. Although Investment20/20 will retain its own brand, it will also turn its focus to growing its successful trainee programme and improving grassroots engagement with school leavers and graduates. Together, the organisations will develop new projects, enrich career entry into the sector at all stages, attract people to change careers and equip young professionals with essential leadership skills. ""We want to build on the excellent track record of Investment20/20 to date and ensure greater diversity is firmly at the heart of the investment industry,"" said Chris Cummings, CEO of IA. ""By joining forces, we can provide more firms access to Investment20/20's services."" Karis Stander, managing director of Investment20/20, added: ""Joining forces with the IA gives us the reach and scale to get in front of tomorrow's workforce.

9-Apr-18,City AM,US intervention pushing Chinese cash to Europe,"GLOBAL mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have started the year with a bang, with deals topping $1 trillion (£710bn) in the first quarter, and more Chinese money than ever flowing into Europe, according to law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. In the first quarter of 2018 alone, Chinese buyers spent a massive $10bn in Europe - half of the $20bn invested in the whole of 2016 and a fair way towards last year's $36bn total. Meanwhile, Chinese focus on the US has shrivelled. After spending $73bn across the pond in 2016, and a tiny $8bn last year, Chinese buyers have so far this year splashed out just $676m in the US. ""Some of the drop can be explained by China's crackdown on 'speculative' outbound investment. Some is down to acquisitive companies overstretching themselves,"" explained Fresh-fields' M&A partners in today's report. ""And some is clearly the result of US hostility - particularly given Beijing's desire to see more deals for strategic technology assets of the kind the US is keen to protect."" One example of US protectionism was the $142bn bid for US chipmaker Qualcomm from Singapore-headquartered Broadcom, which was blocked by President Donald Trump and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius). Freshfields noted that moves in Washington to expand Cfius' powers to block even outbound deals, advocated by congressmen such as Robert Pittenger, could further threaten USChina dealmaking. However, not all of this spare cash may be funnelled into Europe. Freshfields' report noted that European regulation is beginning to get tougher, although it is ""questionable"" whether Europe could afford to shut out Chinese buyers as the US has."
9-Apr-18,City AM,BEST OF THE BROKERS,"The analysts at Liberum have recently got out from behind their screens for a lunch with senior figures from the university research sector. The lunch confirmed their view that publisher Informa should roll-up its journal products into Bertelsmann Springer with Informa taking a minority stake. Such as move would help solve the weaknesses in Informa's product and give it ""greater market clout"". The analysts' believe that Informa's £4bn acquisition of events business UBM will pass regulatory scrutiny and reiterate their ""buy"" rating with a target price of 900p, up from 855p. 29Mar 3 Apr 4Apr 5Apr 6Apr Shore Capital has passed a favourable eye over trading company IG Group's latest trading update, which it said was ""positive"", with volatile market conditions providing a ""helpful backdrop"". Net trading revenue in the three months to 28 February was £152.9m, up 30 per cent on the same quarter last year. Shore reiterates its ""hold"" rating and keeps its share price target at 800p. New trading rules from the European regulator have not influenced its forecast as they were in line with previous assumptions. Dignity is not the only game in town when it comes to funerals, according to analysts Peel Hunt, which note Co-op's increase in funeral numbers last year. Co-op's latest results showed a 2.4 per cent increase in funeral volumes versus Dignity's 2.7 per cent decrease. Peel Hunt is taking a cautious approach, reiterating its ""hold"" rating and its target price of 950p. It also said that it is too early to say what the impact of new pricing models at Dignity will be on its volume of funerals or its profitability over the next year."
9-Apr-18,City AM,Allen & Overy in talks over £2bn US tie-up,"LEADING London-headquartered law firm Allen & Overy (A&O) is in merger talks with US West Coast law firm O'Melveny and Myers to create what would be one of the world's largest law firms. The potential merger, which was reported by website Legal Week, would create a firm with a revenue of £2bn, which would catapult the combined firm into the front rank of global law firms. The merged firm would be the third-largest in the world on currently available figures, behind US behemoths Kirkland & Ellis ($3.2bn [£2.3bn]) and Latham & Watkins ($3.1bn) and ahead of global firms Baker McKenzie ($2.7bn) and DLA Piper ($2.6bn). A&O and its magic circle rivals Clifford Chance, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Linklaters all reported revenues between £1.3bn and £1.4bn last year so a deal would see A&O forge ahead and leave its competitors with serious questions about their strategies. Speaking to Legal Week in 2017 A&O managing partner Andrew Ballheimer said: ""Clients are crying out for a handful of global law firms that are equally at home in the US as they are around the world, and there are no firms in the world at this point in time who fit that mould"". A&O and O'Melveny have similar profitability with A&O's profit per equity partner hitting £1.51m ($2.1m) last year, while O'Melveny's rose three per cent to $2m. A spokesperson for A&O said: ""We talk to many law firms in many countries all of the time and we do not comment on market speculation and rumours regarding any particular firm."" An O'Melveny spokesperson said: ""We have no plans to merge and never have."""
4-Apr-17,City AM,Goldman Sachs sinks down adviser rankings for UK M&A as UBS climbs,"GOLDMAN Sachs has seen a dramatic reduction in the value of UK mergers and acquisitions (M&A) it has advised on so far this year, falling from the top spot in the first quarter of last year to 12th in 2018. In the first three months of 2018, Goldman has been engaged on 15 announced deals with some UK involvement worth a combined $37bn (£26bn), according to Thomson Reuters data. Meanwhile Morgan Stanley, which has manoeuvred into the top spot from second place last year, advised on just 10 deals worth a massive $159bn. Morgan Stanley has been buoyed by headline deals such as the $91bn consolidation of Unilever to a single headquarters in Rotterdam, and the $40bn acquisition of Sky by Comcast in which it is advising Sky. UBS climbed up the rankings, as it rose to second place from eighth last year, advising on $136bn of deals. The last year has seen Goldman take a bit of a battering, as it lost its M&A crown for the whole of 2017 to Morgan Stanley. Across all firms globally, advisory fees have fallen by an estimated average of 11 per cent in 2018."
